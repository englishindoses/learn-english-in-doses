# Unit 1: Airport and Airplane Communication

## Overall Description

This unit prepares beginner level students to navigate airports confidently and communicate effectively during air travel. Students learn essential language for every stage of the airport experience, from check-in through to collecting their baggage. By the end of this unit, students can handle all airport interactions independently, communicate with airline staff, and manage common flight situations.

The unit takes a practical, task-based approach focusing on real situations students will encounter. Each lesson builds communication skills through functional language, essential vocabulary, and key grammar structures needed for that specific airport context.

## How This Unit Teaches

The unit uses a **task-based, functional approach**:

1. **Real contexts**: Each lesson focuses on an actual airport situation students may face.
2. **Essential language first**: Students learn the most useful phrases and vocabulary for each context.
3. **Practical grammar**: Grammar is taught as needed for the specific function.
4. **Interactive practice**: Students learn through online interactive activities with immediate feedback. Lessons start with presenting vocabulary and grammar, then move on to guided practice with gap fills, sentence ordering, and more. Finally, students can choose from a list of scenarios for conversation practice.
5. **Progressive building**: Lessons follow the chronological journey through an airport, building confidence step by step.

The focus is on **communication ability** rather than grammatical perfection, ensuring students can successfully navigate real airport situations independently.
