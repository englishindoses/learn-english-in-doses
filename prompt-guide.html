        <h1 class="section-title">🎓 Who This Is For</h1>
        
        <p>This prompt pack is aimed at <strong>ESL teachers</strong> and <strong>content creators</strong> who want to <strong>use AI as a tool</strong> to help them <strong>enhance</strong> their lessons and save time. It's designed for people who may not be very tech savvy and are uncertain about how to start using AI in their work. This pack was created with ESL teachers in mind, but it can be used by any language teacher or course content creator.</p>

        <p>Technology is becoming an increasingly big part of our lives and that includes the classroom. From having to suddenly abandon books and whiteboards during the pandemic and use online platforms, video conferencing and digital tools, to the fear and uncertainty caused by AI. It sometimes feels like teachers are left to fend for themselves in the deep end.</p>

        <p>With this guide you <strong>don't need any coding knowledge</strong> or experience with AI. You will get <strong>simple, reusable prompts</strong> that generate full lessons, curriculum outlines, and student-friendly learning activities that can be used both <strong>online and in-person</strong>. The prompts are accompanied by notes and follow-up prompts to help you edit, customise and adapt what AI has provided you with to suit your specific needs.</p>

        <p>This doesn't mean that anybody can create high quality materials or that anybody can do a teacher's job. Teachers have invaluable experience and expertise. Teachers have studied hard and trained to be in the position they are in today, and AI cannot yet substitute this expertise. What AI does when you give it a prompt is create a lesson (for example) with activities for the student to do etc. However, there can be a variety of issues with AI's first output. As a teacher, you need to use your professional knowledge and experience to guide AI and edit the first output until it meets your professional standards.</p>

        <p>AI helps you create high quality content much faster, but it can't do it without your guidance and instructions. Think of AI as your assistant, and yourself as a supervisor — you have to give clear instructions, check the output and provide feedback with further instructions until it's perfect.</p>

        <p>This prompt pack will provide you with samples and templates for these instructions and help you familiarise yourself with AI.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <div class="tip-header">📚 Tip:</div>
            Save time by copying your prompt into your chosen AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). You can adjust tone, language level, or structure as needed.

        <h1 class="section-title">🤖 Why Use AI for Lesson Creation?</h1>
        
        <p>Using AI to create ESL lessons has huge benefits for both teachers and students:</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">For Teachers:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly generate fresh ideas tailored to each student.</li>
            <li>Create professional looking content.</li>
            <li>Stay consistent with lesson structure while adding variety.</li>
            <li>Save time on planning and resource creation.</li>
            <li>Reduce stress and burnout.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">For Students:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Get personalised, engaging lessons designed for their level and interests.</li>
            <li>Enjoy interactive activities and visuals that AI can help generate.</li>
            <li>Benefit from a structured learning path that still feels fun and creative.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One of the biggest benefits of using AI to help you prepare lessons is that the speed allows you to tailor each one to each student, helping you enhance your lessons and provide higher quality learning. So if you're sceptical about AI or even afraid to try it, don't worry. Use this guide to do a trial run and experiment with it. Then you can decide exactly how AI can benefit you and your students.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="section-title">🔄 How to Use This Pack</h1>
        
        <p>This guide will provide you with ready made prompts that you can copy and paste into an AI tool (like chatGPT or Claude) to generate original content. Use follow-up prompts to customise, edit or fix errors and make the content your own. Think of prompts as "instructions" that you type into the chat box. Typing prompts is exactly the same as sending an email or typed message with instructions to a colleague.</p>

        <p>There are 3 main steps to follow:</p>

        <div class="workflow-steps">
            <div class="workflow-step">1</div>
            <div class="workflow-step">2</div>
            <div class="workflow-step">3</div>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with a prompt</strong> to generate content.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the content thoroughly.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Follow up with instructions</strong> on what you want to change.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Then simply repeat steps 2 and 3 until you are satisfied with the results.</p>

        Each lesson should include:
        <ul>
            <li>A topic (e.g. food, family, school)</li>
            <li>6–8 vocabulary words</li>

        Present the curriculum as a lesson-by-lesson outline."
    </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Generates an entire beginner course structure in seconds.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Copy and paste the prompt into your AI chat box. Edit the information to what you need. For example, lesson duration, student age or level, content you want included etc.</p>

        <p>Feel free to add any more specifications you might have. You can ask for it to be presented in a table format for example.</p>

        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Example Output (abbreviated):</div>
            <ul>

            <div class="tip-header">💡 Tip:</div>
            After AI has finished generating the content you can ask it for suggestions on how to improve it. For example a prompt like <em>"Please look at the course content and give me suggestions on how to improve it / make it more engaging / integrate CLIL lessons."</em> I sometimes like to specify in this kind of prompt that I don't want it to make changes yet, just give me suggestions.

            <p>Here a full example prompt:<br>
            <em>"Please look at the course content and give me suggestions on how I can improve it. Don't make any changes yet, give me the suggestions so I can choose which ones I like."</em></p>

            <p><strong>You can use this tip after generating any kind of content.</strong></p>

        Keep the tone cheerful and clear. Use a clean layout without coloured backgrounds, but use colours to make it attractive and engaging for a 10-12 year old student."

        <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> This gives you a full lesson worksheet for the student, accompanied by a separate lesson plan for the teacher. Often, AI will use icons and emojis as visual aids. Please check the section on "AI's Abilities, Limitations and Solutions" for further information on images.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> You can edit the prompt to include whatever you want included in your lesson. Put the points in the order you want them to come up in the lesson. You can even give instructions on how you want the lesson to look (colours, layout requirements, fonts etc).</p>

        <p>This is a good opportunity to adapt the lesson for your students. You can also change "one-on-one" to "group classes" etc.</p>

        <p>Don't forget to check the lessons properly and make sure there are no errors, such as vocabulary that doesn't match the icon.</p>

For the grammar section please quickly show what I like or I don't like mean. Use emojis or leave placeholders for images.<br>
For the questions activity add "Yes, I do/ No, I don't" after each question so the student can ask and then circle his answer.<br>
The speaking section is split across two pages. To fix this, please make the drawing activity bigger and put the speaking activity on the next page.<br>
For the drawing activity add emojis of food that would go in a meal (chicken, meat, etc.) also include "meat" and "veg" in the vocabulary section.<br>
For the speaking activity delete the instructions for each sentence and just keep the examples.<br>
Make the homework section smaller so that it fits on the same page as the speaking section. To do this delete the drawing activity for homework.<br>
Make the encouraging message at the end smaller so it fits across the bottom of the page. The last page should have Speaking, Homework, Great Job all on one page - resize the sections to make sure they fit."

            <li>Don't make it unnecessarily wordy.</li>

        <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> It creates a full grammar explanation that should include all the points you mentioned. It also creates a quiz at the end of the grammar explanation that tests the student's understanding of what they have studied.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Again, copy and paste the prompt into your AI tool. You can edit the information and change things like student age, level, grammar topic. You can specify how many examples you want.</p>

        <p>When AI has finished creating the explanation, <strong>always</strong> read it carefully, including the examples and quiz questions. AI can produce brilliant results, but it can make mistakes. It's our responsibility to check the content and make sure it's error free and meets the right needs.</p>

                <li><strong>Activities</strong>: Besides comprehension questions, would you like me to include any other activities? (e.g., vocabulary matching, grammar exercises, discussion questions)</li>
                <li><strong>Specific vocabulary focus</strong>: Are there any particular vocabulary themes you'd like me to emphasize? (e.g., hobbies, school subjects, food, etc.)</li>

            <p>Zara is twelve years old and lives on planet Kepler with her family. She has a mother, a father, and a little brother named Pip. Zara is a student at Kepler Space School.</p>
            
            <p>Every day, Zara wakes up at 7:00 AM. She brushes her teeth with her sonic toothbrush and eats breakfast with her family. Her favorite breakfast is moon cereal with purple milk. After breakfast, she walks to school with her friends. Classes start at 9:00 AM.</p>
            
            <p><strong>...</strong></p>
            
            <h4>Activity 1: Sequencing Events (5 minutes)</h4>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Put Zara's activities from yesterday in the correct order. Write numbers 1-6.</p>
            
            <p>___ Zara played with her brother Pip in the garden<br>
            ___ Zara visited the Crystal Gardens with her class<br>
            ___ Zara woke up late at 8:30 AM<br>
            ___ Zara's family watched a movie about Earth<br>
            ___ Zara ran to school with a space sandwich<br>
            ___ Zara went to bed happy and tired</p>
            
            <p><strong>Answer Key:</strong> 1. Woke up late, 2. Ran to school with sandwich, 3. Visited Crystal Gardens, 4. Played with Pip, 5. Watched movie, 6. Went to bed</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <div class="tip-header">💡 Tip:</div>
            In my first draft I often get teacher's notes (activity duration, answer key etc.). In this case you can simply type "Please delete all teacher's notes, such as duration and answer key." Or, better still, you can ask for 2 separate files "Please create 2 separate files — a worksheet for the student and a lesson plan for the teacher with notes."<br>

        The questions should come up in a random order and not be repeated too often. Include a Start button for the first question and then a next button to navigate through the questions.

        </div>

        <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> This prompt produces an interactive activity in the format of an html file. What you will see when you open it is a title card and when you press start you will see the first prompt. You will then see a "next" button that you can use to go to the next question. Each prompt has 3 vocabulary words or expressions related to the topic and a sentence starter to help students start their answer.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Paste the prompt into AI. You can add or change information to what you want. For example, you specify what colours your want to use, or change the number of questions.</p>

        <p><strong>What you do next:</strong> You simply download the file and double click on it to open it in your browser. It will open up and look like a web page. It's interactive, so you can click on the buttons and the questions should come up randomly.</p>

        <p>When AI has creates the file you will see a preview of it and you should be able to click next and check if the questions are OK. Or you can check through them when you open the file.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <div class="tip-header">💡 Tip:</div>
            If there is an issue with the html file (e.g. the "next" button doesn't work) point it out to the AI and ask it to find the error and fix it. It's good to say exactly what doesn't work and usually the AI will fix it for you. If, by any chance it doesn't, download the file and uploaded into a new chat (or other AI tool) and ask it to find the error again.

            <p>This kind of interactive activity usually works fine since it's not too complicated for AI to code. However, I will leave interactive html content for another time, because it can get a bit more complicated and requires more prompts and patience (although still very much within any esl teacher's reach).</p>

        "You are a professional ESL teacher. Create a short summative assessment for A1 level adult ESL students. It should include:

        <ul>
            <li>A vocabulary section (matching, fill-in-the-blanks, or definition-based).</li>
            <li>A grammar section (focus on [e.g., present simple + past simple]).</li>
            <li>A reading section with a short text and comprehension questions.</li>
            <li>A writing prompt (1 paragraph, guided writing).</li>
        </ul>

        Focus on the following grammar points:
        <ul>
            <li>Verb "to be" (am / is / are).</li>
            <li>Subject pronouns and possessive adjectives.</li>
            <li>Basic question forms and negatives.</li>
        </ul>

        Use the following topics and vocabulary:
        <ul>
            <li>Everyday objects and classroom vocabulary - e.g. book, computer, car.</li>
            <li>Countries, cities, and jobs - e.g. France, Tokyo, doctor.</li>
            <li>Personal information and numbers (1–30) - e.g. age, address, married / one to thirty.</li>
        </ul>

        Make sure the layout of each activity is clear and suitable for that task. Use a neutral tone, and age-appropriate language. Don't use any images. Provide a second file with an answer key and notes for the teacher to mark the writing task."

        </div>

        <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Creates an assessment ready to use with your students and an answer sheet to facilitate your marking.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Paste the prompt into your AI chat box. Replace information such as student age and level, topics, etc. If you know exactly what activities or how many questions you want for each one, type it in.</p>

        Make sure it meets all of the following criteria:

            <li>Design suitable for A4 paper with standard margins.</li>
            <li>Logical page breaks that doesn't break up content.</li>
            <li>Professional and engaging design for adult ESL students.</li>

        <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> It converts your content into a professional looking HTML file. You can open in your browser, click print, and save it as a PDF. This prompt also asks AI to make sure that, when printing or saving as a PDF, page breaks are in appropriate places, so you shouldn't have content split up awkwardly.</p>

        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Paste this prompt into your AI chat and edit the information with the styles, colours and other visual requirements you have. When the file is ready, click on download as HTML. Then click on your file to open it and it will open in your browser. Right click on the document and click print, then choose save as PDF.</p>

        <p>The underlined sentence <em>(but keep all of the colours from the HTML.)</em> makes it so that when you click print, the file maintains all the colours. You can also make it so that when you click print it loses background colours and makes it more printer-friendly and ink-saving. To do this, change the underlined instruction to <em>"make it print-friendly without coloured backgrounds"</em>.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">🛠️ Technical Guidance</h1>
        
        <h2 class="subsection-title">How to add images</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Most common AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude etc.) can't add images to the files they create.</strong> They can add icons and emojis, which are fine for some kinds of content and for titles, etc. But this is usually not enough for vocabulary activities where you want images to show the meaning of the word.</p>

        <p><strong>So how can we add images to our worksheets?</strong> Here are easy methods:</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Method 1: Using editing tools you're familiar with</h3>
        <p><strong>If you already create your own materials and use tools like pdf editors, canva, microsoft office etc, you can use these to add images the way you usually do.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="sub-subsection-title">Method 1.1: Annotate with Kami or other PDF editor you already use:</h3>
        <p>Personally, I use Kami google extension to share and collaborate on worksheets with my students. So what I do sometimes is while in the lesson, when the student asks me what a word means, I google and image and then copy and paste it onto the pdf in Kami. Then I resize it, draw lines or add a note to make the connection. You can also do this before the lesson with all the vocabulary if you prefer.</p>

        <p>You can ask AI to leave a placeholder box in place of the images for the matching activity (for example) and then paste the images over those boxes.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-subsection-title">Method 1.2: Use Canva, powerpoint or other editing tools:</h3>
        <p><strong>You can copy and paste your content into editing tools like powerpoint or canva (or whatever you currently use) and add images your usual way.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Method 2: Using AI:</h3>
        <p><strong>Although AI can't simply add images on it's own, there are a few way you can provide it with the images for it to add to the html code. You can even do this yourself if you're a little tech savvy, but if you're like me then you need AI's help.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="sub-subsection-title">2.1: Use the image address:</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - You find an image you want to use on the <strong>internet</strong> (for example, through google search or websites that have images available for free use).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong> — Right click on the image and click on "copy <strong>image</strong> address" (<strong>not</strong> copy link address)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong> — Paste the image address into the AI chat and ask it to add the image to the document. You can even specify size and position.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-subsection-title">2.2: Local file reference.</h3>
        <p><strong>You can save the image on your computer and then send AI the path reference. This is much simpler than it sounds. Follow these simple steps:</strong></p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3 class="mini-title">On Windows:</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1</strong> — Hold down <strong>shift</strong> on your keyboard and <strong>right click</strong> on the image.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2</strong> — Click on "copy as path"</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3</strong> — Paste into the AI chat and ask it to add this image to your document. You can add specifications like size or position.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mini-title">On Mac:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the image file</li>
                <li>Press <strong>Cmd + Option + C</strong></li>
                <li>Paste into AI chat and ask it to add this image to your document. <strong>You can add specifications like size or position.</strong></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>This method is an easy way to add images you have downloaded from Canva or other online image sources.</strong></p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <div class="tip-header">💡 Tip:</div>
            Use folders <strong>on your computer</strong> to organise your files and images to keep things tidy and make it easier.

        <h1 class="section-title">⚠️ AI Limitations & Solutions</h1>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Bumps and Fixes When Using AI</h2>
        
        <p>As helpful as AI can be, it can still make mistakes or fail to follow all the instructions you gave. It's vital that you always check what AI has produced to ensure the quality and authenticity of your work. These bumps can sometimes be difficult to deal with, especially if you haven't faced them before.</p>

        <p>Here are some common issues that I have come across and how to deal with them quickly and efficiently.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">🔁 1. AI Doesn't Follow All Instructions First Time</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You asked for a grammar explanation with exactly 5 examples, but it gave 3.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Follow up with a specific prompt like:</p>
        
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Follow-up Prompt Example:</div>
            "Please give me 2 more examples using natural-sounding language from work and daily life."
        </div>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You asked AI to format your document and gave it a list of requirements but it didn't meet these requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Sometimes when there are many requirements, you might get one that slips through the cracks. In this case, edit the prompt you sent to AI, cut the requirement it missed and paste it higher on the list. Usually this will solve the problem.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">❌ 2. Inaccurate or Incorrect Content</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> AI may get grammar rules wrong or give false information.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always read through your content carefully, especially when dealing with grammar and examples. If there's an error, reply with:</p>
        
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Error Correction Examples:</div>
            "There's a mistake in the example. 'She has ate' is incorrect. Please fix it."<br><br>
            "This sentence is not true 'When writing academic articles the passive voice is common but active voice is preferred for clarity' — Please replace it with something else."
        </div>

        <p>You can also give it the exact sentence you want to replace it with.</p>

        <p>You can also ask AI to double-check:</p>
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Double-check Prompts:</div>
            "Please revise the grammar explanation and ensure all examples follow correct rules."<br><br>
            "Please proofread the worksheet and look for any errors or inconsistencies."
        </div>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">🧱 3. Clunky Layout or Visual Output</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The layout looks crowded, colours are too bright for print, or headings are missing.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Point these issues out using a follow-up like this:</p>
        
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Layout Fix Examples:</div>
            "Please format this with clear headings, space between sections, and a print-friendly background."<br><br>
            "Use pastel colours and boxes to separate sections. Keep the background white for printing."
        </div>

        <p>You can also click on "retry" next to the "edit" button on the previous prompt. Sometimes the second try is better, sometimes not much changes. In that case use a prompt similar to the ones above and give the requirements you want it to meet.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">🧠 4. Content Is Too Complicated or Too Simple</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A worksheet for A1 students includes vocabulary like "environmentally conscious" or complex instructions. — This one happens to me often, especially when making material for beginner young learners who have very limited vocabulary.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ask for adjustments:</p>
        
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Level Adjustment Examples:</div>
            "Please simplify this for A1 level students."<br><br>
            "Rewrite the instructions using simple language."<br><br>
            "Make this more appropriate for a B2 level student."
        </div>

        <p>You could also specify in your original prompt that<br>
        "the students have very limited vocabulary so make sure to use simple instructions"</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">🎯 5. It can't actually do something that you've asked</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You asked it to create an activity the presents new vocabulary with images (e.g. jobs and professions). Unable to actually include pictures on its own, AI either uses emojis or placeholders or image descriptions instead of images.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This doesn't happen very often as there aren't that many things that AI can't do for you in this context. Being aware of limitations (such as the ability to add images) and how to get around them can help you avoid this situation altogether.</p>

        <p>But, should it come up, here's what to do:</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Double check the limitations of the AI tool you're using. You can simply ask it:</p>

        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Limitation Check:</div>
            "You added image descriptions instead of actual images. Please explain why you did this."
        </div>

        <p>Sometimes, depending on the tool, it will explain that it can't do what you've asked and may even give you alternative options. You can ask:</p>

        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Alternative Options:</div>
            "What alternative options do I have?"<br><br>
            "How can I add images using AI?"
        </div>

        <p>Sometimes, it may say something along the lines of "You're absolutely right to point that out!" and proceed to admit to its mistake, promise to fix it, but then the results are exactly the same as before. This can cause a bit of a spiral, in which case I like to ask another AI with something like:<br>
        "Can claude.ai add images to my worksheet on its own? What options do I have?"</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">📄 6.1. Page Break Issues in PDFs</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> When saving an AI-generated file as a PDF, activities may be cut in half.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use this in your prompt:</p>
        
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Page Break Fix:</div>
            "Please format it so that page breaks do not separate questions from their answer space. Optimise for A4 with full pages and proper margins."
        </div>

        <p>If you want to keep background colours in the PDF, specify:</p>
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Color Retention:</div>
            "Please make sure that when I save this as a PDF, the colours are retained."
        </div>

        <p>If you've already included this requirement in your prompt but it didn't follow it, replying with a follow up prompt should solve the issue.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">📄 6.2. Pages With Big Gaps</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> When creating page breaks and keeping content together, sometimes you may end up with a page that has one little section that doesn't even take up half of it because the next section was too big and needed a page on its own.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> Ask AI to resize sections:</p>
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Section Resizing:</div>
            "Page 3 has one small section and the rest of the page is blank. Please resize sections in order to avoid this issue."
        </div>

        <p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Specify yourself where you want the page breaks.</p>
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Manual Page Breaks:</div>
            "Please change the page breaks as follows: A break between Activity 1 Question 3 and Question 4, and a break before the Wrap up section."
        </div>

        <p><strong>Solution 3:</strong> Add a small section of content to fill the gap:</p>
        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Content Addition:</div>
            "On the first page there is the title and the introduction to the grammar rule and then there is a big gap. Please include a new section with examples of the grammar rule in use to fill this gap."
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-subsection-title">Alternative Page Break Solution:</h3>
        <p>Sometimes I find that, perhaps depending on the size of each section, AI finds it difficult to get the page breaks right. In these cases I tell it specifically where to put the page breaks. Here is an example prompt you can use:</p>

        <div class="example-output">
            <div class="example-header">Specific Page Break Instructions:</div>
            "Please put the page breaks in the following positions:<br>
            - Before Activity 2.<br>
            - Between questions 4 and 5 in activity 3.<br>
            - Resize activity 4 to fit on the same page as the rest of activity 3.<br>
            - Fit the homework and encouraging message on the last page."
        </div>

        <p><strong>This prompt might be a little wordy but it specifies exactly where the page breaks should go and makes it easier for AI to do it how you want. Sometimes this is an easier solution than giving it the choice.</strong></p>

        <h1 class="section-title">©️ Copyright and Plagiarism Considerations</h1>
        
        <p><strong>For the most part, content created by you using AI belongs to you</strong> and you are free to use it however you want. However, plagiarism and copyright laws still apply and they can depend on context and the purpose of the content you're creating. Here are some ethical and unethical uses of AI generated content.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">What can I do with the content I generated using AI?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use it in my class.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sell it.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Post it.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>You don't need to say that you created using AI, if you don't want to.</strong> However, many people like to mention it just to be transparent. Also using AI shows you're keeping up with modern technology and using it to improve the quality of your work. Students might appreciate that.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">What shouldn't I do with the content generated using AI?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use AI to copy someone else's content without permission.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Use AI to rewrite copyrighted material and sell it.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Submit content created using AI to a place that requires original human content.</strong> For example, academic journals, research grants etc. Always check the rules first.</li>
            <li><strong>If your school, platform or company doesn't allow the use of AI generated content.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important-box">
            <p><strong>Remember to always check the policies of the tools and resources you use. Always comply with regulations set by your employer, school, etc.</strong></p>

        <h1 class="section-title">🎓 Tips for Best Results</h1>
        
        <p>Here are some tips and advice to help you optimise your results and be able to reuse the same prompts for a variety of content.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Think of AI as a human assistant (who works really fast and know almost everything). If you were asking your assistant to prepare a lesson plan for you, what information would you give them?</li>
            <li>You can ask AI for advice and suggestions. You can talk to it as if you were messaging a colleague. Explain what you want to do and say "Please give me some suggestions".</li>
            <li>If you have a ready document with specifications you want to follow (such as guidelines you already use) you can upload the document to AI, tell it to read the guidelines carefully and use them to produce the content you want.</li>
            <li>Upload samples of content, such as lesson plans, you already have and ask AI to use them as a template.</li>
            <li>Add the student's gender, age, or interests to personalise prompts and outputs. For example, if you have a student who likes sports, just type "my student is a 14 year old girl who likes football" or "My student is an adult who's living in the UK and needs to communicate at work and in daily life."</li>
            <li>Reuse your own best-performing prompts as templates. Especially the "style it up!" prompt. This can help you maintain a visual consistency across your content and build your brand. Visual consistency across lessons is also important for students.</li>
            <li>Create your own prompt list or prompt library. When you have a prompt that gave you something great, save it with a clear title so you can copy and paste it again. For example, you edit the prompt to produce a nice looking lesson for your beginner students — save it. Then you edit the prompt for advanced adult students — save that one too.</li>
            <li>Use follow-up prompts like "Make this more visual" or "Simplify for A1 level". AI rarely gives you perfect results first time, so always check the outcome and follow up.</li>
            <li>Sometimes AI might miss one of your requirements. If this happens, simply repeat that requirement in a follow up.</li>
            <li>Combine with Canva, Google Slides, or Notion for easy formatting. If you already use editing tools like Canva, you can copy the content AI gives you and paste it into your Canva worksheet, for example, and continue editing it as you normally would. This way you can do the formatting yourself instead of AI.</li>
            <li>AI is changing and developing all the time. Some models allow you to link other online tools to the AI. At the time this prompt pack was being created, for example, Claude had a new feature and could link with Canva to create designs. After you become more familiar with AI, it might be worth checking out these kinds of features and testing them to see what you can do with them.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>✅ Final Tip: Think of AI as your assistant, and yourself as the editor-in-chief.</h3>
            
            <p>AI's output is like a first draft — <strong>it's not ready yet</strong>. You need to use your expertise and spend time to <strong>check it</strong>, <strong>edit it</strong> and ensure the <strong>quality</strong> of your final product. It's <strong>your</strong> expert knowledge and opinion that you have developed throughout your career that makes the final product <strong>yours</strong> and suitable for <strong>your students</strong>.</p>
