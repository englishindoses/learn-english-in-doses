      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Both the Past Perfect and Past Perfect Progressive (also called Past Perfect Continuous) are advanced tenses that help us talk about actions that happened before another point in the past. Though similar, they have important differences in how we use them and what they emphasize.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand when to use the Past Perfect and Past Perfect Progressive</li>
          <li>Form correct sentences in both tenses</li>
          <li>Choose the appropriate tense to communicate your meaning clearly</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Past Perfect Tense</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Main concept</strong>: The Past Perfect tense is used to talk about an action that was completed before another action in the past. It shows the earlier of two past actions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: subject + had + past participle</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>When I arrived at the party, Tom had already left. (Tom left before I arrived)</li>
            <li>She had finished her homework before dinner. (She finished her homework, then had dinner)</li>
            <li>They hadn't visited Paris until last year. (Their first visit to Paris was last year)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use the Past Perfect with time expressions like "already," "just," "never," "by the time," and "before" to make the sequence of events clearer. For example: "I was disappointed because they had already seen the film without me."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Past Perfect Progressive Tense</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Main concept</strong>: The Past Perfect Progressive tense emphasizes the ongoing nature or duration of an action that was in progress before another action in the past. It focuses on the activity itself and often explains results.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: subject + had been + verb-ing</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I had been working for five hours when my computer crashed. (The working was in progress, then the computer crashed)</li>
            <li>She was tired because she had been running. (She ran for some time, which made her tired)</li>
            <li>They had been living in London for ten years before they moved to Paris. (Their living in London was a continuous action)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use the Past Perfect Progressive to explain the cause of something in the past, especially with physical states like being exhausted, hungry, or out of breath. For example: "He was out of breath because he had been running to catch the train."</p>

      <h2 class="tips-heading">Useful Tips</h2>
      
      <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Use Past Perfect when the action was complete before another past moment. Use Past Perfect Progressive when the action was still in progress or had just finished with visible results.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Look for time expressions to help you choose: "for three hours" or "since morning" often signal Past Perfect Progressive, while "by then" or "already" often signal Past Perfect.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> When explaining why something happened or someone's condition in the past, Past Perfect Progressive is often the better choice: "He was wet because he had been swimming."</p>
