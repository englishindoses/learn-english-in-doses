      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Present Perfect Progressive and Present Perfect Simple are two advanced English tenses that can sometimes be confusing because they are used in similar situations. This lesson will help you understand when to use each tense and how they differ in meaning.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form the Present Perfect Progressive and Present Perfect Simple correctly</li>
          <li>Understand the key differences between these two tenses</li>
          <li>Use both tenses appropriately in conversation and writing</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1: Present Perfect Simple -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Present Perfect Simple</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic meaning</strong>: The Present Perfect Simple is used to talk about completed actions that have a connection to the present or actions that occurred at an unspecified time in the past.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: subject + have/has + past participle</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <em>have finished</em> my homework. (The homework is now complete)</li>
            <li>She <em>has lived</em> in London for ten years. (She still lives there)</li>
            <li>They <em>have visited</em> Paris three times. (Completed visits that happened at some point in the past)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use the contracted forms "I've", "you've", "he's", "she's", etc. in casual speech. For negative forms, they often use "haven't" and "hasn't".</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2: Present Perfect Progressive -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Present Perfect Progressive</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic meaning</strong>: The Present Perfect Progressive (also called Present Perfect Continuous) focuses on an ongoing action that started in the past and continues until now, or has just finished with results visible in the present.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: subject + have/has + been + verb-ing</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <em>have been working</em> on this project for three hours. (Started in the past and still working now)</li>
            <li>She <em>has been living</em> in London for ten years. (Started living there ten years ago and still lives there)</li>
            <li>It <em>has been raining</em> all day. (Started in the past and still raining or just stopped)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use this tense to explain a current situation, especially when they are tired, upset, or showing evidence of the activity: "Sorry about the mess, I've been painting the living room."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3: Key Differences -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Key Differences</h2>
        
        <p>The main differences between these two tenses are what they emphasize:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Present Perfect Simple</strong> emphasizes <em>completion</em> or <em>results</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Present Perfect Progressive</strong> emphasizes the <em>duration</em> or <em>ongoing nature</em> of the action.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>Compare these examples:</p>

          <tr>
            <td>I've read five books this month.</td>
            <td>I've been reading this book all week.</td>
            <td>The simple form focuses on completed books (result), while the progressive focuses on the ongoing activity of reading.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>She has written a report.</td>
            <td>She has been writing a report.</td>
            <td>The simple form suggests the report is finished, while the progressive suggests she's still working on it.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>They have played tennis.</td>
            <td>They have been playing tennis.</td>
            <td>The simple form states they played (completed activity), while the progressive implies they recently finished or might still be playing.</td>

        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> If you want to emphasize how long something has been happening, use Present Perfect Progressive: "I've been waiting for two hours!"</p>

      <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> For actions that are completed with clear results or achievements, use Present Perfect Simple: "I've written three emails this morning."</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Remember that state verbs (like know, believe, have, own) are rarely used in Progressive forms. Use Present Perfect Simple instead: "I've had this car for five years" (not "I've been having").</p>
