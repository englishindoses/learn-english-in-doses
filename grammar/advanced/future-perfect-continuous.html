      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Future Perfect and Future Perfect Continuous are advanced tenses used to talk about actions that will be completed or will be in progress before a specific time in the future. Understanding these tenses helps you express future plans and expectations more precisely, particularly in professional and academic contexts.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form and use both the Future Perfect and Future Perfect Continuous correctly</li>
          <li>Understand when to choose one tense over the other</li>
          <li>Express complex ideas about future actions with appropriate time markers</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Future Perfect: Form and Usage</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + will + have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Future Perfect is used to talk about actions that will be completed before a specific time in the future. It emphasizes the completion or result of the action.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>By next month, I <span class="grammar-highlight">will have finished</span> the project. [I'll complete it before next month]</li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">will have cooked</span> dinner by the time you get home. [The dinner will be ready when you arrive]</li>
            <li>They <span class="grammar-highlight">will have visited</span> five countries by the end of their European tour. [They'll complete visits to five countries before the tour ends]</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In speech, native speakers often contract "will have" to "will've" or "I'll've", which can be difficult to hear: "I'll've finished it by then." Because these contractions can be hard to pronounce, speakers might simplify to just "I'll finish it by then" in very casual conversation.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Future Perfect Continuous: Form and Usage</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + will + have + been + verb-ing</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Future Perfect Continuous is used to talk about actions that will be in progress over a period of time before a specific point in the future. It emphasizes the duration or ongoing nature of the action.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>By December, I <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been working</span> at this company for five years. [I started working here 5 years ago and will continue until at least December]</li>
            <li>Next week, she <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been studying</span> English for two years. [She began studying 2 years ago and continues now]</li>
            <li>By the time they reach London, they <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been travelling</span> for more than 10 hours. [Their journey will be ongoing for 10 hours when they arrive]</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> The full form "will have been" is often contracted to "will've been" or "I'll've been" in speech: "I'll've been working here for five years."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Time Markers with Future Perfect and Future Perfect Continuous</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Common time expressions</strong>: Certain time expressions are frequently used with these tenses to specify the future reference point.</p>
        
        <p><strong>With Future Perfect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>By + time</strong>: By next week, by 2030, by the end of the month</li>
          <li><strong>By the time + clause</strong>: By the time you arrive, by the time we finish</li>
          <li><strong>Before + time</strong>: Before next year, before the deadline</li>
          <li><strong>This time + future time reference</strong>: This time next month</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>With Future Perfect Continuous:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For + time period + by phrase</strong>: For ten years by then</li>
          <li><strong>Since + starting point + by phrase</strong>: Since January by next month</li>
          <li><strong>All + time period + by phrase</strong>: All day by the time we finish</li>
          <li><strong>How long + by phrase</strong>: How long will you have been waiting by 6pm?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>By June, John <span class="grammar-highlight">will have completed</span> his training. [Time marker: by + month]</li>
            <li>By the time the boss arrives, we <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been preparing</span> for hours. [Time marker: by the time + clause]</li>
            <li>This time next year, she <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been teaching</span> for a decade. [Time marker: this time + future reference + for + period]</li>

      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Key Differences and Choosing Between the Tenses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Focus on completion vs. duration</strong>: Your choice depends on whether you want to emphasize the completion of an action or its duration before a future point.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these pairs:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>By June, I <span class="grammar-highlight">will have saved</span> ¬£5,000. (Focus on the completed amount)<br>
            By June, I <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been saving</span> money for two years. (Focus on the ongoing process)</li>
            <br>
            <li>By 2026, they <span class="grammar-highlight">will have built</span> three new hospitals in the region. (Focus on the completed result)<br>
            By 2026, they <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been building</span> the new hospital for five years. (Focus on the ongoing activity)</li>
            <br>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">will have written</span> ten reports by next week. (Focus on the number of completed reports)<br>
            She <span class="grammar-highlight">will have been writing</span> reports all week. (Focus on the continuous activity)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> With stative verbs (know, believe, own, like, understand, etc.), use Future Perfect rather than Future Perfect Continuous: "By next year, I will have owned this house for ten years" (not "will have been owning").</p>
