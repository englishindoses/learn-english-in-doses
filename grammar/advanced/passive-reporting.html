      <h1>Passive Reporting Verbs</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
<section class="intro-section">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Passive reporting verbs are used to report information, opinions, or beliefs without stating the source directly. These structures are particularly common in news reports, academic writing, and formal discussions where the emphasis is on the information rather than who provided it. Using these structures effectively adds sophistication to your English and helps you sound more like a native speaker in formal contexts.</p>
  
  <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use passive reporting structures with present and past reference</li>
    <li>Form complex passive constructions with reporting verbs</li>
    <li>Incorporate these advanced structures appropriately in formal writing and speaking</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Basic Passive Reporting Structures</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + infinitive</p>

  <p><strong>Common reporting verbs in passive form</strong> (ordered from high to low certainty):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>is/are known to... (highest certainty)</li>
    <li>is/are understood to...</li>
    <li>is/are considered to...</li>
    <li>is/are expected to...</li>
    <li>is/are believed to...</li>
    <li>is/are thought to...</li>
    <li>is/are reported to...</li>
    <li>is/are said to...</li>
    <li>is/are supposed to...</li>
    <li>is/are alleged to... (lowest certainty)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use these structures when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reporting general opinions or information</li>
    <li>The source of information is unknown or unimportant</li>
    <li>Writing formally, especially in academic or journalistic contexts</li>
    <li>Discussing widely accepted facts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Different levels of certainty</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High certainty: is known to, is understood to</li>
    <li>Medium certainty: is believed to, is considered to</li>
    <li>Low certainty: is said to, is alleged to</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">is said to be</span> developing a new smartphone. (when information comes from rumors or unofficial sources)</li>
      <li>The treatment <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to</span> reduce symptoms in most patients. (when there is evidence but not complete proof)</li>
      <li>The manuscript <span class="grammar-highlight">is thought to</span> date back to the 14th century. (when experts have this opinion)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Complete example with context</strong>:<br>
  Although no official announcement has been made, the company <span class="grammar-highlight">is said to be</span> planning major layoffs next month. (shows how this structure is used to report unofficial information)</p>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual conversation, native speakers rarely use these structures. Instead, they use phrases like "I heard that...", "Apparently...", or "They say that..."</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Passive Reporting with Past Reference</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + to have + past participle (V3)</p>
  
  <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use this structure when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reporting something that happened in the past</li>
    <li>Distancing yourself from the reliability of the information</li>
    <li>Discussing historical events or past actions</li>
    <li>Reporting news about past events</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The politician <span class="grammar-highlight">is said to have accepted</span> bribes from business leaders. (when reporting allegations)</li>
      <li>The painting <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to have been stolen</span> during the war. (when discussing a historical event with some uncertainty)</li>
      <li>The patient <span class="grammar-highlight">is reported to have recovered</span> completely after the treatment. (when citing medical reports)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Complete example with context</strong>:<br>
  Despite his denials, the minister <span class="grammar-highlight">is alleged to have received</span> illegal campaign funds during the last election. (shows how media might report accusations)</p>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This structure is common in news reporting when facts need to be presented without the reporter taking responsibility for their accuracy. In everyday speech, people often say "I heard he did..." or "Apparently she went..."</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Complex Passive Reporting Structures</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form for ongoing actions</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + to be + verb-ing</p>
  
  <p><strong>Form for passive states</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + to be + past participle (V3)</p>
  
  <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use these complex forms when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reporting current ongoing actions (to be verb-ing)</li>
    <li>Reporting a passive situation or state (to be + past participle)</li>
    <li>Discussing formal or academic topics</li>
    <li>When precise timing or state is important</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The prime minister <span class="grammar-highlight">is reported to be considering</span> a cabinet reshuffle. (ongoing action with political significance - medium certainty)</li>
      <li>The suspect <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to be hiding</span> somewhere in the mountains. (current ongoing situation in news reporting - medium-high certainty)</li>
      <li>The ancient temple <span class="grammar-highlight">is considered to be preserved</span> in its original state. (passive state with historical importance - high certainty)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Complete example with context</strong>:<br>
  According to unofficial sources, the two companies <span class="grammar-highlight">are understood to be negotiating</span> a merger that could change the industry landscape. (shows how business news reports unconfirmed ongoing processes)</p>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> These complex forms are almost exclusively used in formal writing. In conversation, native speakers simplify to "They're apparently working on..." or "I heard it's being built by..."</p>
  </div>

<!-- TIPS SECTION -->
<section class="tips">
  <h2 class="tips-heading">Useful Tips</h2>
  
  <div class="grammar-tip">
    <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Choose the right reporting verb based on certainty level. Use "is known to" for established facts, "is believed to" for general consensus, and "is alleged to" for unproven claims that might be controversial.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="grammar-tip">
    <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> To convert an active reporting sentence to passive, follow this pattern:
    <br>- Active: "People say that he works hard." ‚Üí Passive: "He is said to work hard."
    <br>- Active: "Scientists believe that she discovered a new species." ‚Üí Passive: "She is believed to have discovered a new species."</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="grammar-tip">
    <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> In academic writing, use passive reporting verbs to maintain an objective tone and avoid direct attribution. However, in personal communication, use simpler alternatives like "apparently" or "I've heard that" which sound more natural.</p>

      'q2': "'Is known to' expresses the highest level of certainty, appropriate for scientific facts.",
      'q3': "When converting from active to passive reporting, 'People believe that...' becomes 'is believed to...'",
      'q4': "For past events with medium certainty, 'is thought to have been hidden' is the appropriate form.",
      'q5': "To report ongoing actions with low certainty, use 'are said to be' followed by the -ing form.",
      'q6': "'Are believed to' expresses medium-high certainty appropriate for expert archaeological opinions.",
      'q7': "For future predictions, 'is expected to cause' uses the simple infinitive form.",
      'q8': "To transform a past action into passive reporting, use 'is reported to have collapsed'.",
      'q9': "For current ongoing research, 'is understood to be working' with the continuous infinitive is most appropriate.",
      'q10': "For a passive situation with high certainty, 'is known to be designed' is the correct form."

      'q1': "Incorrect. When reporting unverified information, use a passive reporting structure with appropriate certainty level.",
      'q2': "This doesn't express the high level of certainty needed for scientific facts. Try a reporting verb with higher certainty.",
      'q3': "Incorrect transformation. Remember the pattern for converting active reporting to passive reporting.",
      'q4': "This form doesn't correctly report a past action. For past events, use 'to have been + past participle'.",
      'q5': "Incorrect form for reporting ongoing actions. For continuous actions, use 'to be + verb-ing'.",
