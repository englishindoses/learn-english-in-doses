      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Passive reporting verbs are used to report information, opinions, or beliefs without stating the source directly. These structures are particularly common in news reports, academic writing, and formal discussions where the emphasis is on the information rather than who provided it. Using these structures effectively adds sophistication to your English and helps you sound more like a native speaker in formal contexts.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use passive reporting structures with present and past reference</li>
          <li>Form complex passive constructions with reporting verbs</li>
          <li>Incorporate these advanced structures appropriately in formal writing and speaking</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Basic Passive Reporting Structures</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + infinitive</p>

        <p><strong>Common reporting verbs in passive form</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>is/are said to...</li>
          <li>is/are thought to...</li>
          <li>is/are believed to...</li>
          <li>is/are considered to...</li>
          <li>is/are reported to...</li>
          <li>is/are known to...</li>
          <li>is/are understood to...</li>
          <li>is/are expected to...</li>
          <li>is/are supposed to...</li>
          <li>is/are alleged to...</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use these structures when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reporting general opinions or information</li>
          <li>The source of information is unknown or unimportant</li>
          <li>Writing formally, especially in academic or journalistic contexts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">is said to be</span> developing a new smartphone. (present situation)</li>
            <li>The treatment <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to</span> reduce symptoms in most patients. (general fact)</li>
            <li>The manuscript <span class="grammar-highlight">is thought to</span> date back to the 14th century. (present state)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> These structures are much more common in written English, especially in newspapers and academic writing, than in casual conversation.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Passive Reporting with Past Reference</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + to have + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use this structure when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reporting something that happened in the past</li>
          <li>Distancing yourself from the reliability of the information</li>
          <li>Discussing historical events or past actions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The politician <span class="grammar-highlight">is said to have accepted</span> bribes from business leaders. (past action)</li>
            <li>The painting <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to have been stolen</span> during the war. (past passive)</li>
            <li>Several witnesses <span class="grammar-highlight">are reported to have seen</span> the accident. (past experience)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This structure allows you to report past events without committing to their truth. It's especially useful in journalism when facts haven't been fully verified.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Complex Passive Reporting Structures</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form for ongoing actions</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + to be + verb-ing</p>
        
        <p><strong>Form for passive infinitives</strong>: subject + passive reporting verb + to be + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use these complex forms when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reporting current ongoing actions (to be verb-ing)</li>
          <li>Reporting a passive situation or state (to be + past participle)</li>
          <li>Discussing formal or academic topics</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The prime minister <span class="grammar-highlight">is reported to be considering</span> a cabinet reshuffle. (ongoing action)</li>
            <li>The suspect <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to be hiding</span> somewhere in the mountains. (current situation)</li>
            <li>The ancient text <span class="grammar-highlight">is thought to be written</span> in a previously unknown language. (passive state)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> These complex forms sound very formal and are typically found in news reports and academic writing rather than everyday speech.</p>

          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Passive reporting structures are excellent for academic writing and formal reports when you want to distance yourself from the information or when the source isn't important.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> To remember the structure, think of the pattern: subject + is/are + reporting verb + to + verb form. The verb form changes depending on whether you're talking about present (to be), past (to have been), or ongoing actions (to be verb-ing).</p>
