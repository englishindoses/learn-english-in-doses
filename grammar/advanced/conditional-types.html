      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Conditionals are sentence structures used to discuss possibilities, hypothetical situations, and their consequences. They help us talk about real and unreal situations in the present, future, and past. English has several types of conditionals, each used for different situations with varying degrees of probability.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify and use the five conditional types correctly (zero, first, second, third, and mixed).</li>
          <li>Express real, possible, and hypothetical situations with the appropriate conditional form.</li>
          <li>Create more nuanced expressions using mixed conditionals to connect past and present.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Zero and First Conditionals (Real conditions)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Zero Conditional</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: If + present simple, present simple</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the zero conditional for general truths, facts, and things that always happen as a result of something else. There is a 100% chance that the condition leads to the result.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If you <span class="grammar-highlight">heat</span> water to 100¬∞C, it <span class="grammar-highlight">boils</span>. (Scientific fact)</li>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">don't drink</span> coffee in the morning, I <span class="grammar-highlight">get</span> a headache. (Personal fact)</li>
            <li>If you <span class="grammar-highlight">press</span> this button, the machine <span class="grammar-highlight">starts</span>. (Instruction/general truth)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>First Conditional</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: If + present simple, will + infinitive</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the first conditional for real possibilities in the future - things that are likely to happen if a certain condition is met. There is a strong possibility that the condition will be fulfilled.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If it <span class="grammar-highlight">rains</span> tomorrow, I <span class="grammar-highlight">will stay</span> at home. (Possible future situation)</li>
            <li>If you <span class="grammar-highlight">finish</span> this report today, the boss <span class="grammar-highlight">will be</span> very pleased. (Likely outcome at work)</li>
            <li>If we <span class="grammar-highlight">don't hurry</span>, we <span class="grammar-highlight">will miss</span> our flight. (Warning about future consequence)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In conversation, native speakers often use "going to" or present continuous instead of "will" in the first conditional: "If it rains tomorrow, I'm going to stay home" or "If you finish this report, the boss is giving you a bonus."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Second and Third Conditionals (Unreal conditions)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Second Conditional</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: If + past simple, would + infinitive</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the second conditional for unreal or unlikely situations in the present or future. These are hypothetical situations or things that are improbable.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">won</span> the lottery, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would buy</span> a house. (Unlikely, but possible in future)</li>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">spoke</span> Chinese, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would apply</span> for that job. (I don't speak Chinese now)</li>
            <li>What <span class="grammar-highlight">would you do</span> if you <span class="grammar-highlight">had</span> more free time? (Hypothetical present situation)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Third Conditional</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: If + past perfect, would have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the third conditional for impossible situations in the past - things that didn't happen, but we imagine what the result would have been if they had happened.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">had studied</span> harder, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would have passed</span> the exam. (I didn't study hard enough, so I failed)</li>
            <li>If she <span class="grammar-highlight">had arrived</span> earlier, she <span class="grammar-highlight">would have met</span> the CEO. (She didn't arrive early, so she didn't meet the CEO)</li>
            <li>If they <span class="grammar-highlight">hadn't missed</span> their train, they <span class="grammar-highlight">would have been</span> on time. (They missed their train, so they weren't on time)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use contractions in conditionals: "If I'd studied harder, I would've passed" (third conditional) or "If I had more time, I'd learn Spanish" (second conditional).</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Mixed Conditionals</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: There are two common mixed conditional patterns:</p>
        <p>1. If + past perfect, would + infinitive (Past condition ‚Üí Present result)</p>
        <p>2. If + past simple, would have + past participle (Present condition ‚Üí Past result)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use them</strong>: Use mixed conditionals when the time in the if-clause is different from the time in the main clause. They're used to connect past and present situations.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Type 1: Past condition ‚Üí Present result</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">had studied</span> medicine, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would be</span> a doctor now. (I didn't study medicine in the past, so I'm not a doctor now)</li>
            <li>If she <span class="grammar-highlight">hadn't moved</span> to London, she <span class="grammar-highlight">wouldn't work</span> for that company now. (She moved to London in the past, so she works for that company now)</li>
            <li>If he <span class="grammar-highlight">had taken</span> that job in Paris, he <span class="grammar-highlight">would live</span> abroad now. (He didn't take the job, so he doesn't live abroad now)</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Type 2: Present condition ‚Üí Past result</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">weren't</span> afraid of flying, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would have visited</span> Japan last year. (I am afraid of flying now, so I didn't visit Japan)</li>
            <li>If she <span class="grammar-highlight">spoke</span> French, she <span class="grammar-highlight">would have applied</span> for that position. (She doesn't speak French now, so she didn't apply)</li>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">liked</span> coffee, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would have ordered</span> an espresso earlier. (I don't like coffee now, so I didn't order one)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Mixed conditionals can be difficult even for native speakers. They're used more in written English or formal speech rather than casual conversation. In everyday conversation, people might use simpler forms to express these complex ideas.</p>

        <h2>Probability Scale for Conditionals</h2>

          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Think of conditionals on a probability scale: Zero (100% - facts), First (likely future), Second (unlikely present/future), Third (impossible past). This helps you choose the right form based on how probable the situation is.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Remember the fixed verb tense patterns for each conditional type and learn them as formulas. Create a flashcard for each type with the formula and a simple example you can easily remember.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Practice constructing mixed conditionals by first identifying whether the condition is in the past or present, and whether the result is in the past or present. This will help you choose the correct structure.</p>
