      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Participle clauses are shortened sentences that use a participle (verb-ing or past participle (V3)) instead of a full clause with a subject and finite verb. They allow us to combine two pieces of information efficiently and elegantly. You will find participle clauses in both written and spoken English, though they are more common in writing and formal speech. In casual conversation, speakers often prefer full clauses with words like "when," "while," or "because." Understanding participle clauses will help you write more concisely and sound more sophisticated when speaking in formal situations.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use present participle clauses (verb-ing) to describe actions and give reasons.</li>
          <li>Use past participle (V3) clauses to express passive meaning and states.</li>
          <li>Choose between present and past participle clauses based on whether the subject is active or passive.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="grammar-summary">
        <h2>Present Participle Clauses (verb-ing)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span> + rest of clause, + main clause</p>
        <p>Or: main clause, + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span> + rest of clause</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use present participle clauses when the subject of both clauses is the same and the subject is <em>doing</em> the action (active meaning).</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Actions at the same time:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Walking to work</span>, I listened to a podcast.<br>(I walked and listened at the same time)</li>
            <li>She sat at her desk, <span class="grammar-highlight">checking her emails</span>.<br>(She sat and checked at the same time)</li>
            <li>He waited for the train, <span class="grammar-highlight">reading the news on his phone</span>.<br>(He waited and read at the same time)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>One action before another:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Turning the corner</span>, I bumped into an old friend.<br>(First I turned the corner, then I bumped into someone)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Finishing her presentation</span>, she answered questions from the audience.<br>(First she finished, then she answered)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Putting on his coat</span>, he headed out the door.<br>(First he put on his coat, then he headed out)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Giving a reason:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Feeling tired</span>, I went to bed early.<br>(= Because I felt tired, I went to bed early)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Not wanting to be late</span>, we took a taxi.<br>(= Because we didn't want to be late, we took a taxi)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Knowing the area well</span>, she offered to show us around.<br>(= Because she knew the area well, she offered)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Showing a result:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The storm damaged the roof, <span class="grammar-highlight">causing a leak</span>.<br>(The damage resulted in a leak)</li>
            <li>He missed his flight, <span class="grammar-highlight">ruining his holiday plans</span>.<br>(Missing the flight resulted in ruined plans)</li>
            <li>She got the promotion, <span class="grammar-highlight">making her the youngest manager in the company</span>.<br>(The promotion resulted in her becoming the youngest manager)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Of these uses, "giving a reason" and "actions at the same time" are the most common in everyday speech. You might hear someone say "Not knowing what to do, I just waited" or "I sat there thinking about it." The "result" structure (e.g., "causing a leak") is more typical of news reports and formal writing.</p>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Participle Clauses (V3)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">past participle (V3)</span> + rest of clause, + main clause</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use past participle (V3) clauses when the subject <em>receives</em> the action or is in a particular state (passive meaning). The participle clause replaces a passive construction.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Passive meaning:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Built in 1900</span>, the house is still in excellent condition.<br>(= The house was built in 1900)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Written in French</span>, the novel was difficult for me to read.<br>(= The novel was written in French)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Made from recycled materials</span>, these bags are environmentally friendly.<br>(= The bags are made from recycled materials)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Describing a state or condition:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Exhausted from the journey</span>, we went straight to sleep.<br>(= We were exhausted from the journey)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Impressed by her CV</span>, they invited her for an interview.<br>(= They were impressed by her CV)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Disappointed by the result</span>, the team left quietly.<br>(= The team was disappointed by the result)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Past participle clauses describing feelings (e.g., "Exhausted from work...", "Surprised by the news...") are fairly common in speech. However, passive descriptions like "Built in 1900..." or "Written in French..." are much more typical of written English — guidebooks, news articles, and formal descriptions.</p>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 - KEY DIFFERENCE -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Choosing Between Present and Past Participles</h2>
        
        <p>The key difference between present and past participle clauses is whether the subject is <strong>active</strong> (doing the action) or <strong>passive</strong> (receiving the action or in a state).</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these pairs:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Surprising</span> everyone, she won the competition.<br>(She surprised everyone — she did the action = active = verb-ing)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Surprised</span> by the news, she didn't know what to say.<br>(She was surprised — she received the feeling = passive = V3)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Boring</span> the audience, the speaker continued for another hour.<br>(The speaker bored the audience = active = verb-ing)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Bored</span> by the lecture, the students started checking their phones.<br>(The students were bored = passive = V3)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Confusing</span> everyone, he changed the plan at the last minute.<br>(He confused everyone = active = verb-ing)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Confused</span> by the instructions, she asked for help.<br>(She was confused = passive = V3)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Quick test</strong>: Ask yourself: "Is the subject doing the action, or is the action happening to the subject?"</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Subject does the action → use <strong>verb-ing</strong></li>
          <li>Action happens to the subject → use <strong>past participle (V3)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> The subject of the participle clause must be the same as the subject of the main clause. Compare: ✓ "Walking home, <strong>I</strong> saw my old teacher" (I was walking, I saw) vs. ✗ "Walking home, <strong>the rain</strong> started" (the rain wasn't walking!). If the subjects are different, use a full clause: "While I was walking home, the rain started."</p>

        <h2 class="tips-heading">Useful Tips</h2>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Always check: "Who or what is doing the action?" If the subject is doing it, use verb-ing. If the subject receives it or is in a state, use the past participle (V3).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Before using a participle clause, identify the subject of your main clause. Then ask: "Is this the same person/thing doing or experiencing the participle action?" If not, use a full clause with "when," "while," or "because" instead.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> In casual conversation, full sentences often sound more natural: "Because I was tired, I left early" rather than "Being tired, I left early." Save participle clauses for writing or more formal speaking situations.</p>
