      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Inverted conditionals are an advanced grammar structure used in formal English and literature. Instead of using "if" at the beginning of a conditional sentence, the subject and auxiliary verb are inverted (switched around). This creates a more formal and sometimes more dramatic way to express hypothetical situations.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding and using inverted conditionals will help you sound more sophisticated in formal writing and recognize these structures when reading academic texts or literature. They are especially common in business English and formal speeches.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognize inverted conditional structures in written and spoken English</li>
          <li>Change regular "if" conditionals into inverted conditionals</li>
          <li>Use inverted conditionals correctly in formal writing and speaking</li>
          <li>Understand the nuances and emphasis that inverted conditionals create</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Basic Structure of Inverted Conditionals</h2>
  
  <p>Inverted conditionals are made by removing "if" and changing the word order.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the word "if"</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move the auxiliary verb (had, were, should) to the beginning</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place the subject after the auxiliary verb</p>
  
  <p>Look at these simple examples:</p>
  
  <div class="example">
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
    <p>Normal: <span style="color:#e74c3c">If</span> <span style="color:#27ae60">I </span><span style="color:#3498db">had</span> more time, I would study more.</p>
    <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <span style="color:#3498db">Had </span><span style="color:#27ae60">I</span> more time, I would study more.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
    <p>Normal: <span style="color:#e74c3c">If</span> <span style="color:#27ae60">she</span> <span style="color:#3498db">were</span> here, she would help us.</p>
    <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <span style="color:#3498db">Were</span> <span style="color:#27ae60">she</span> here, she would help us.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Inverted conditionals are mostly used in formal writing and speeches. They are not common in everyday conversation.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Types of Inverted Conditionals</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Second Conditional (Present/Future Unreal Situations)</strong></p>
        <p>In the second conditional, we use "were" for all subjects in the inverted form, even with "I", "he", "she", and "it".</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>Standard: If I were rich, I would buy a yacht.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Were I rich</strong>, I would buy a yacht.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Standard: If she were here, she would help us.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Were she here</strong>, she would help us.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Third Conditional (Past Unreal Situations)</strong></p>
        <p>In the third conditional, we use "had" + past participle in the inverted form.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>Standard: If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Had he studied</strong> harder, he would have passed the exam.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Standard: If they had arrived earlier, they would have seen the sunset.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Had they arrived</strong> earlier, they would have seen the sunset.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> First conditional sentences (real possibilities) are rarely inverted in modern English. "Should you need anything, please call me" is sometimes used instead of "If you should need anything, please call me."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Inverted Conditionals with Modal Verbs</h2>
        
        <p>Some conditionals with modal auxiliaries can also be Inverted:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>With should:</strong></p>
          <p>Standard: If you should see Mary, tell her to call me.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Should you see</strong> Mary, tell her to call me.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>With were to:</strong></p>
          <p>Standard: If he were to win the lottery, he would retire immediately.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Were he to win</strong> the lottery, he would retire immediately.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>With could (in the meaning of "if it were possible"):</strong></p>
          <p>Standard: If I could change one thing, it would be my attitude.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Could I change</strong> one thing, it would be my attitude.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> The inverted form with "should" is quite common in formal contexts and can sometimes indicate a lower probability than a regular "if" conditional. For example, "Should you require any assistance..." suggests it's less likely you'll need help compared to "If you need any assistance..."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Negative Inverted Conditionals</h2>
        
        <p>Forming negative inverted conditionals follows a special pattern:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>With had:</strong></p>
          <p>Standard: If I had not seen it myself, I wouldn't have believed it.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Had I not seen</strong> it myself, I wouldn't have believed it.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>With were:</strong></p>
          <p>Standard: If it were not for your help, I would have failed.</p>
          <p><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted: <strong>Were it not for</strong> your help, I would have failed.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Also common: <strong>Were it not for</strong> your help = <strong>Without</strong> your help</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Notice that the negative word (not) comes <em>after</em> the subject in inverted conditionals.</p>

      <!-- WHEN TO USE SECTION -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>When to Use Inverted Conditionals</h2>
        
        <p>Inverted conditionals are typically used in:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Formal writing</strong> - academic papers, business reports, formal letters</li>
          <li><strong>Literary contexts</strong> - novels, poetry, plays</li>
          <li><strong>Formal speeches</strong> - political addresses, ceremonial speeches</li>
          <li><strong>Legal language</strong> - contracts, legal documents</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>They create a more formal, sophisticated tone and sometimes add emphasis or dramatic effect to the conditional statement.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>In a formal business context:</p>
          <p><em>Standard:</em> If the client agrees to our terms, we will proceed with the project.</p>
          <p><em><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted:</em> Should the client agree to our terms, we will proceed with the project.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In a literary context:</p>
          <p><em>Standard:</em> If I had known then what I know now, my decision would have been different.</p>
          <p><em><span style="margin:0 3px;">⇄</span>Inverted:</em> Had I known then what I know now, my decision would have been different.</p>

      <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>📝 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Remember that "were" is used for all subjects in second conditional inversions, even with "I", "he", "she", and "it".</p>
