      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Perfect infinitives and perfect gerunds allow you to express complex time relationships in a concise way. These advanced verb forms add time depth to your sentences by showing actions that occurred before the main verb. Mastering these forms will significantly enhance the sophistication and precision of your English.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form and use perfect infinitives (to have done) correctly.</li>
          <li>Use perfect gerunds (having done) in appropriate contexts.</li>
          <li>Express completed actions before a main verb.</li>
          <li>Understand and use common verb patterns with perfect infinitives and gerunds.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="grammar-summary">
        <h2>Perfect Infinitives: Form and Basic Uses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: to + have + past participle (to have done, to have seen, to have gone, etc.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the perfect infinitive to express an action that happened <em>before</em> the main verb in the sentence. It creates a clear time sequence, showing that one action preceded another.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"She claims <span class="grammar-highlight">to have met</span> the president last year." (The meeting happened before her claim)</li>
            <li>"I'm happy <span class="grammar-highlight">to have finished</span> the project on time." (The finishing happened before the feeling of happiness)</li>
            <li>"They appear <span class="grammar-highlight">to have solved</span> the problem." (The solving seems to have happened already)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use perfect infinitives in formal contexts or in writing more than in casual conversation. In conversational English, they might use a that-clause instead: "She claims that she met the president last year."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Perfect Infinitives with Modal Verbs</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: modal verb + have + past participle (should have done, might have seen, etc.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Perfect infinitives with modal verbs express hypothetical past situations, missed opportunities, past possibility, probability, or obligation.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"You <span class="grammar-highlight">should have called</span> me earlier." (Past obligation or advice that wasn't followed)</li>
            <li>"They <span class="grammar-highlight">might have missed</span> the train." (Past possibility)</li>
            <li>"He <span class="grammar-highlight">must have forgotten</span> our appointment." (Strong past probability)</li>
            <li>"I <span class="grammar-highlight">could have helped</span> you if you had asked." (Past possibility that didn't happen)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> The tone and emphasis of modal perfect infinitives can vary greatly. "You should have called" often conveys criticism, while "could have helped" can express regret or missed opportunity. Native speakers frequently use these forms to express judgments about past actions.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Perfect Gerunds: Form and Basic Uses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: having + past participle (having done, having seen, having gone, etc.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the perfect gerund to talk about an action that happened <em>before</em> another action, especially after prepositions or certain verbs that are followed by gerunds.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"She denied <span class="grammar-highlight">having taken</span> the money." (The taking happened before the denial)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">Having finished</span> my work, I went home." (The finishing happened before going home)</li>
            <li>"He regrets <span class="grammar-highlight">having told</span> her the secret." (The telling happened before the regret)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Perfect gerunds are less common in conversational English. Instead of "She denied having taken the money," a native speaker might say "She denied that she took the money." However, perfect gerunds are common in formal writing and academic contexts.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Verbs Commonly Used with Perfect Infinitives</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: specific verb + to have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Certain verbs frequently take perfect infinitives to show that the infinitive action happened before the main verb. These include verbs of claiming, reporting, perception, and feeling.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>Claim/Report: "He <span class="grammar-highlight">claims to have worked</span> with many celebrities." (The working happened before the claim)</li>
            <li>Seem/Appear: "They <span class="grammar-highlight">seem to have left</span> already." (The leaving appears to have happened in the past)</li>
            <li>Pretend: "She <span class="grammar-highlight">pretended to have forgotten</span> about the incident." (She acted as if she had forgotten)</li>
            <li>Be + adjective: "I'm <span class="grammar-highlight">pleased to have met</span> you." (The meeting happened before the feeling of pleasure)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> With reporting verbs like "claim," "say," or "report," native speakers often prefer a that-clause in conversation: "He says that he worked with celebrities" rather than "He claims to have worked with celebrities," which sounds more formal.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 5 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Verbs Commonly Used with Perfect Gerunds</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: specific verb + having + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Certain verbs take gerunds, and when you need to express that the gerund action happened before the main verb, you use a perfect gerund. Common verbs include those expressing feelings, denial, or admission.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>Deny/Admit: "He <span class="grammar-highlight">denied having seen</span> the document." (The seeing allegedly happened before the denial)</li>
            <li>Regret/Remember: "I <span class="grammar-highlight">regret having told</span> her the truth." (The telling happened before the regret)</li>
            <li>Appreciate/Thank: "They <span class="grammar-highlight">appreciated having been informed</span> in advance." (The informing happened before the appreciation)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Expressions of regret frequently use perfect gerunds: "I regret having said that" is common in both spoken and written English, though "I regret that I said that" is also frequently used in casual conversation.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 6 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Perfect Infinitives and Gerunds with Prepositions</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <br>Preposition + having + past participle<br>for/except/instead of + to have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: After prepositions, we typically use gerunds, including perfect gerunds. In a few cases, especially with 'for', 'except', and 'instead of', we may see perfect infinitives.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"They congratulated him <span class="grammar-highlight">for having won</span> the competition." (Preposition + perfect gerund)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">Despite having studied</span> all night, I failed the exam." (Preposition + perfect gerund)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">After having lived</span> abroad for ten years, she returned home." (Preposition + perfect gerund)</li>
            <li>"She had no choice <span class="grammar-highlight">except to have trusted</span> him." (Exception with perfect infinitive)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> With time prepositions like "after" or "before," native speakers often drop the word "having" in casual speech: "After living abroad" instead of "After having lived abroad." In formal writing, however, the perfect form is more common.</p>

          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Think of perfect infinitives and gerunds as "time machines" that take you back before the main verb. They show that one action happened before another.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Remember the verb patterns: some verbs are typically followed by infinitives (claim, appear, seem), while others are followed by gerunds (deny, admit, regret).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> To decide whether to use a perfect form, ask yourself: "Did this action happen before the action in the main clause?" If yes, the perfect form is usually needed.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 4:</strong> With modal verbs, perfect infinitives usually express hypothetical past situations or judgments about past actions: "should have done," "could have gone," "must have been."</p>
