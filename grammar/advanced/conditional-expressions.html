      <h1>Advanced Conditional Expressions</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Conditional expressions like "unless," "provided that," and "as long as" help us communicate conditions in more precise and varied ways than basic if-clauses. These expressions allow you to express negative conditions, requirements, and ongoing circumstances that affect outcomes.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use "unless" correctly to express negative conditions.</li>
          <li>Apply "provided that" and "providing that" to express requirements and stipulations.</li>
          <li>Use "as long as" and "so long as" to describe continuing conditions.</li>
          <li>Choose the most appropriate conditional expression for different situations.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="unless">
        <h2>Unless</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Unless + present simple/continuous, main clause (will/modal + verb)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: "Unless" means "if...not" or "except if." We use it to express negative conditions‚Äîsituations where something will happen <em>only if</em> a particular condition is <em>not</em> met. It presents the only circumstance that would prevent the main clause from happening.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Unless</span> we finish this report by 5 pm, the client will be very unhappy. (= If we don't finish the report by 5 pm, the client will be very unhappy.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Unless</span> it rains tomorrow, I'll go for a long walk in the park. (= If it doesn't rain tomorrow, I'll go for a long walk in the park.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Unless</span> you book tickets in advance, you won't get seats on that flight. (= If you don't book tickets in advance, you won't get seats.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use "unless" when they want to mention an exception that would change a planned course of action. For example, in a work setting: "I'll be at the meeting at 2pm unless the client calls with those urgent changes." In casual conversation, you might hear: "We're going to the beach tomorrow, unless it rains, in which case we'll go to the cinema instead." Notice how native speakers sometimes follow "unless" with "in which case" to clarify the alternative plan.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="provided-that">
        <h2>Provided that / Providing that</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Provided (that) / Providing (that) + present simple/continuous, main clause (will/modal + verb)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: "Provided that" or "providing that" (both forms are correct) express a specific requirement or condition that must be fulfilled for the main clause to happen. These expressions emphasize the importance of the condition being met. The word "that" is optional.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>You can use my car <span class="grammar-highlight">provided (that)</span> you return it with a full tank of petrol. (The condition of returning the car with a full tank must be fulfilled.)</li>
            <li>We'll finish the project on time <span class="grammar-highlight">providing (that)</span> everyone works efficiently. (The project will be completed on time only if the condition of efficient work is met.)</li>
            <li>The hotel will offer a discount <span class="grammar-highlight">provided (that)</span> you stay for at least three nights. (The discount depends on meeting the minimum stay requirement.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Provided that" sounds somewhat formal and is more common in written English and business contexts. You'll often hear it in contract discussions: "We'll deliver by next Friday, provided that we receive the materials on time." In everyday conversation, many native speakers would simply use "if" instead: "I can help you move house if you have all your stuff packed." When you do hear "provided" in speech, it's usually without "that": "You can borrow my car, provided you fill it up before returning it."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="as-long-as">
        <h2>As long as / So long as</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: As long as / So long as + present simple/continuous, main clause (will/modal + verb)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: "As long as" and "so long as" (both mean the same thing) express a continuing condition that must remain true for the main clause to be valid. They suggest that the outcome depends on a condition being maintained over time or consistently applied.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>You can borrow my laptop <span class="grammar-highlight">as long as</span> you don't download any software. (You can borrow it on the continuing condition that no software is downloaded.)</li>
            <li>I'll help you move house <span class="grammar-highlight">so long as</span> we finish before dinner time. (My help is conditional on finishing by dinner time.)</li>
            <li>The tour guide will answer questions <span class="grammar-highlight">as long as</span> they're relevant to the tour. (The willingness to answer questions has the ongoing condition of relevance.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "As long as" is very common in everyday speech, especially when making arrangements or setting boundaries. You might hear a parent say to a child: "You can go to the party as long as you're back by 11." Or between friends: "I'm happy to share my Netflix account as long as you don't change my password." The tone often carries a slight warning or limitation. "So long as" means the same thing but sounds slightly more formal: "The company will support your project so long as it stays within budget."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 - Key differences/Choosing between forms -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="differences">
        <h2>Key Differences: Choosing the Right Expression</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Key differences</strong>: Choosing between these expressions depends on what aspect of the condition you want to emphasize:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unless</strong>: Emphasizes a negative condition or exception</li>
          <li><strong>Provided that</strong>: Emphasizes a strict requirement that must be met</li>
          <li><strong>As long as</strong>: Emphasizes a continuing condition or boundary</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these pairs:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Unless</span> I hear otherwise, I'll send the report tomorrow. (Emphasizes that sending the report is the default plan, with only one thing that might prevent it.)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Provided that</span> I get your feedback, I'll send the report tomorrow. (Emphasizes that getting feedback is a necessary requirement.)</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Unless</span> it's too expensive, we'll stay at the Grand Hotel. (Emphasizes that high cost is the only potential barrier.)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">As long as</span> it's reasonably priced, we'll stay at the Grand Hotel. (Emphasizes the ongoing condition of reasonable pricing.)</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Provided that</span> you follow the safety guidelines, you can use the equipment. (Emphasizes that following guidelines is a strict requirement.)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">As long as</span> you follow the safety guidelines, you can use the equipment. (Similar meaning, but emphasizes the continuing nature of following guidelines.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In many cases, native speakers use these expressions somewhat interchangeably, especially "as long as" and "provided that," with the choice often being a matter of personal preference or slight difference in emphasis rather than strict grammatical distinction.</p>

          <p class="correct">Unless we finish this by tomorrow, the project will fail. ‚úì</p>
          <p class="explanation"><em>With "unless" (and most conditional expressions), we use the present simple in the conditional clause (even when talking about the future), not "will." Remember to use present simple for the condition and will/would for the result.</em></p>

          <p class="correct">Unless you hurry, we'll miss the train. ‚úì</p>
          <p class="explanation"><em>"Unless" already implies a negative condition (it means "if not"), so adding another negative creates a confusing double negative. Keep the verb in the clause after "unless" in its positive form.</em></p>

          <p class="explanation"><em>In this context, "provided that" is a fixed phrase functioning as a conditional conjunction. It's not the past tense of the verb "provide." There should be no subject before "provided that" when used as a conditional expression.</em></p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> When using "unless," try mentally replacing it with "if...not" to check if your sentence still makes sense. This can help you avoid double negatives and ensure you're using it correctly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> For formal writing such as business emails or academic essays, "provided that" often sounds more appropriate than "as long as," which has a more conversational tone.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> These conditional expressions can appear at the beginning or in the middle of sentences. When they appear at the beginning, remember to use a comma after the conditional clause: "As long as you study hard, you'll pass the exam."</p>
