      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Modal verbs in English go far beyond expressing simple concepts like ability (can) or obligation (must). At an advanced level, modals express subtle meanings like reproach, criticism, and varying degrees of probability, which are essential for natural, nuanced communication in English.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use modal verbs to express reproach, regret, and criticism about past actions</li>
          <li>Express different degrees of probability about present and past situations</li>
          <li>Recognize and respond to the subtle shades of meaning in modal verbs</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Modal Verbs for Reproach and Criticism</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Expressing reproach about past actions</strong>: We often use modal verbs to suggest someone should or shouldn't have done something in the past.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: subject + modal verb + have + past participle</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>You <span class="modal-highlight">should have called</span> me yesterday. (I expected you to call, but you didn't)</li>
            <li>He <span class="modal-highlight">shouldn't have said</span> that to his boss. (What he said was inappropriate)</li>
            <li>They <span class="modal-highlight">could have told</span> us about the problem earlier. (They had the opportunity but didn't)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In spoken English, "should have" is often contracted to "should've" and sometimes incorrectly written as "should of" in informal contexts. Always use "should have" in your writing.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Degrees of criticism and reproach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Should have/shouldn't have</strong>: The strongest form of criticism or advice about a past action</li>
          <li><strong>Could have</strong>: Indicates a missed opportunity or alternative</li>
          <li><strong>Might have</strong>: Suggests a possibility that wasn't taken</li>
          <li><strong>Needn't have</strong>: Indicates unnecessary action that was taken</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Modal Verbs for Expressing Probability</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Expressing different degrees of certainty</strong>: Modal verbs help us show how sure or unsure we are about something.</p>
        
        <p><strong>About present situations:</strong></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="modal-highlight">must be</span> at home. Her car is in the driveway. (95% certain)</li>
            <li>He <span class="modal-highlight">will be</span> in his office now. He always works until 6. (90% certain)</li>
            <li>They <span class="modal-highlight">should be</span> at the meeting by now. (80% certain)</li>
            <li>She <span class="modal-highlight">may/might/could be</span> busy at the moment. (50% certain)</li>
            <li>He <span class="modal-highlight">can't be</span> serious about that suggestion. (0% certain - negative certainty)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>About past situations:</strong></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="modal-highlight">must have been</span> very tired after the marathon. (95% certain)</li>
            <li>He <span class="modal-highlight">will have arrived</span> in London by now. (90% certain)</li>
            <li>They <span class="modal-highlight">should have received</span> our email by yesterday. (80% certain)</li>
            <li>She <span class="modal-highlight">may/might/could have forgotten</span> about our appointment. (50% certain)</li>
            <li>He <span class="modal-highlight">can't have finished</span> the project already - it's too complex. (0% certain - negative certainty)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Context is crucial when interpreting modals. For example, "must" can express obligation ("You must attend") or high probability ("You must be joking"). Listen for tone of voice and context clues.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Other Advanced Modal Meanings</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Expressing missed opportunities and alternatives</strong>: Modal verbs can express regret about what did or didn't happen.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If I'd known you were coming, I <span class="modal-highlight">would have prepared</span> something special. (hypothetical past result)</li>
            <li>I <span class="modal-highlight">needn't have bought</span> so much food. Most of it went to waste. (unnecessary past action)</li>
            <li>You <span class="modal-highlight">didn't need to pay</span> for everyone. We could have split the bill. (factual - action happened but wasn't necessary)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Expressing regret:</strong></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <span class="modal-highlight">should have studied</span> harder for the exam. (I regret not studying harder)</li>
            <li>We <span class="modal-highlight">shouldn't have ignored</span> the warning signs. (We regret ignoring them)</li>
            <li>I <span class="modal-highlight">wish I could have attended</span> your wedding. (I regret that I couldn't attend)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The difference between "needn't have done" and "didn't need to do":</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Needn't have done</strong>: The action WAS done, but it was unnecessary (regret/reproach)</li>
          <li><strong>Didn't need to do</strong>: The action WAS NOT done because it was unnecessary (neutral statement)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>You <span class="modal-highlight">needn't have bought</span> me a gift. (You did buy a gift, but it wasn't necessary)</p>
          <p>You <span class="modal-highlight">didn't need to buy</span> me a gift. (You didn't buy a gift, which was fine)</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> To express different degrees of probability, remember this scale: must be (95%) → will be (90%) → should be (80%) → may/might/could be (50%) → can't be (0%).</p>
