      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Apart from the standard passive voice formed with "be + past participle (V3)", English offers alternative passive constructions using "get" and "have". These constructions are common in everyday speech and add different nuances to passive meanings. Understanding these alternative forms will enhance your ability to express subtle differences in meaning and register.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form passive sentences using "get" instead of "be".</li>
          <li>Use "have something done" structures correctly.</li>
          <li>Choose appropriately between "be", "get", and "have" passive constructions.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Get-Passive</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + get + past participle (V3) + (by + agent)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use get-passive when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasising a change of state or unexpected event</li>
          <li>Speaking informally or conversationally</li>
          <li>Focusing on the receiver of the action (especially with benefit or suffering)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>My phone <span class="grammar-highlight">got stolen</span> at the concert last night. (negative, unexpected event)</li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">got promoted</span> after only six months with the company. (positive change)</li>
            <li>The children <span class="grammar-highlight">got caught</span> playing in the neighbour's garden. (unexpected consequence)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> The get-passive is much more common in spoken English than in formal writing. It often carries an emotional tone and suggests something unexpected happened.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Have-Passive (Causative)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + have + object + past participle (V3) + (by + agent)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use have-passive when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Someone arranges for another person to do something</li>
          <li>The subject does not perform the action themselves</li>
          <li>Describing services that are paid for or requested</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">had our house painted</span> last month. (We arranged for someone to paint it)</li>
            <li>I'm <span class="grammar-highlight">having my hair cut</span> tomorrow. (I've booked an appointment)</li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">had its website redesigned</span> by a professional. (They paid for this service)</li>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This structure doesn't necessarily indicate who performed the action, but implies the subject arranged for it to happen.</p>

      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Key Differences Between Be, Get, and Have Passives</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Different structures with different meanings and nuances</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use each</strong>: Your choice depends on the context, formality, and focus.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these pairs:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>My car <span class="grammar-highlight">was repaired</span> yesterday. (Simple fact, neutral)<br>
                My car <span class="grammar-highlight">got repaired</span> yesterday. (Implies satisfaction, informal)<br>
                I <span class="grammar-highlight">had my car repaired</span> yesterday. (I arranged and paid for the service)</li>
            <li>The fence <span class="grammar-highlight">was broken</span> during the storm. (Just stating what happened)<br>
                The fence <span class="grammar-highlight">got broken</span> during the storm. (Emphasises the change, slight surprise)<br>
                I <span class="grammar-highlight">had the fence painted</span> before their visit. (Deliberately arranged for this to happen)</li>
            <li>Her story <span class="grammar-highlight">was published</span> in a magazine. (Formal statement)<br>
                Her story <span class="grammar-highlight">got published</span> in a magazine. (Implies achievement, informal)<br>
                She <span class="grammar-highlight">had her story published</span> in a magazine. (She took action to make it happen)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often choose between these forms based on subtle nuances they want to express. The choice between "be/get/have" can significantly change the implications of a sentence.</p>

          'q3': "Correct! This is a tricky use of get-passive for a negative experience. This sentence actually means someone stole your wallet, not that you arranged it.",
          'q4': "Correct! This shows a company experiencing bankruptcy (a negative event) using get-passive.",
          'q5': "Correct! 'Had the house painted' implies you arranged for someone else to paint it, while 'The house was painted' is simply stating a fact.",
          'q6': "Correct! Get-passive is more informal and commonly used in casual conversations.",
          'q7': "Correct! 'Had' is used for the causative structure when someone arranges for a service.",
          'q8': "Correct! This is not a causative construction - it's simply past perfect tense. For causative, it should be 'We had our house painted last summer.'",
          'q9': "Correct! 'I had my car fixed' means I arranged for someone to repair it, matching the meaning of 'I paid a mechanic to fix my car.'",
          'q10': "Correct! 'Got published' suggests a personal achievement and has a sense of effort or accomplishment."
        },
        incorrectExplanations: {
          'q1': "This sentence is not formed correctly. For describing a planned service, use 'I'm having my hair cut tomorrow' or 'I'm getting my hair cut tomorrow.'",
          'q2': "This is not the have-passive (causative) structure. It's simply saying you cleaned it yourself.",
          'q3': "That's not what this sentence means. Despite using 'got', this is a common expression for a negative experience (being the victim of theft).",
          'q4': "This sentence doesn't correctly use get-passive for a negative event.",
          'q5': "These two forms have different meanings. The causative structure with 'had' implies arrangement.",
          'q6': "Get-passive is informal and not appropriate for formal writing contexts.",
          'q7': "This isn't the correct verb for the causative structure when arranging for a service.",
          'q8': "This sentence is correctly formed.",
          'q9': "This doesn't have the same meaning as the original sentence, which implies arranging and paying for a service.",
          'q10': "This construction doesn't particularly emphasize personal achievement or effort like the get-passive does."
