      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>These structures allow English speakers to talk about situations they want to change or hypothetical scenarios they desire. Understanding how to use "wish," "if only," and "would rather" helps you express regrets about the past, things you want to change in the present, and hopes for the future in a natural way.</p>
        
        <p>In professional settings, social situations, and academic contexts, these structures are frequently used to discuss preferences, share feelings about decisions, and negotiate politely with others.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Express regrets about past situations using "wish" and "if only."</li>
          <li>Talk about things you want to change in the present using appropriate verb forms.</li>
          <li>Use "would rather" to express preferences in different time frames.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Using "wish" and "if only" for present situations</strong>: We use these structures to talk about things we want to be different now.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: wish/if only + past simple (or "could" + base verb)</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I wish I spoke better English. (I don't speak English well now.)</li>
            <li>She wishes she had more time to exercise. (She doesn't have enough time now.)</li>
            <li>If only the weather were warmer today. (The weather is cold now.)</li>
            <li>I wish I could swim. (I can't swim now.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In informal situations, native speakers sometimes say: "I wish I was taller" instead of the grammatically correct "I wish I were taller."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <p><strong>Using "wish" and "if only" for past regrets</strong>: We use these structures to express regret about past situations that cannot be changed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: wish/if only + past perfect (had + past participle)</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I wish I had studied harder for the exam. (I didn't study hard enough.)</li>
            <li>If only I had arrived earlier, I would have met your parents. (I arrived late and missed them.)</li>
            <li>She wishes she had taken that job offer last year. (She didn't take the job.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> You might hear native speakers say: "I wish I never went there" in casual conversation, when the grammatically correct form would be "I wish I had never gone there."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <p><strong>Using "would rather" for preferences</strong>: We use this structure to express preferences between two or more options.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>would rather + base verb (for present/future)<br>
          Example: I would rather work from home. (This is my preference now.)</li>
          <li>would rather + have + past participle (for past)<br>
          Example: She would rather have gone to the beach. (This was her preference then.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I would rather work from home than commute to the office. (This is my preference.)</li>
            <li>She would rather have gone to the conference herself. (This was her preference in the past.)</li>
            <li>Would you rather meet on Tuesday or Wednesday? (Which day do you prefer?)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual speech, native speakers often contract "would rather" to "I'd rather" or even just "rather" in quick speech.<br>
          Example: "I'd rather stay home" or "Rather stay home than go out tonight."</p>
