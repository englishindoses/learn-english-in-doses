      <h1>Inversion for Emphasis</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Inversion for emphasis is an advanced structure where we change the normal word order to create a more formal or dramatic effect. This happens most commonly after negative adverbials—words or phrases that express a negative idea. When these negative expressions come at the beginning of a sentence, we invert the subject and auxiliary verb, similar to question form.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use inversion after negative adverbials to add emphasis in formal writing and speech.</li>
          <li>Identify when inversion is appropriate and when normal word order should be used.</li>
          <li>Create sentences with various negative adverbials that require inversion.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="grammar-summary">
        <h2>Common Negative Adverbials that Require Inversion</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: negative adverbial + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use inversion after negative adverbials to add emphasis or formality. This structure is common in formal writing, literature, and speeches.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common negative adverbials:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>never</strong> - never have/has/did + subject + verb</li>
          <li><strong>rarely/seldom</strong> - rarely/seldom do/does/did + subject + verb</li>
          <li><strong>hardly/scarcely/barely</strong> - hardly/scarcely/barely had + subject + V3</li>
          <li><strong>not only</strong> - not only do/does/did + subject + verb</li>
          <li><strong>under no circumstances</strong> - under no circumstances should/must + subject + verb</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Never</span> have I seen such terrible traffic on the motorway.<br>(emphasising how unusually bad the traffic was)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Rarely</span> does the board approve budget increases without detailed justification.<br>(emphasising the strict approval process in formal business writing)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Seldom</span> have I witnessed such a stunning sunset over the mountains.<br>(emphasising the exceptional beauty in a dramatic way)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In everyday conversation, native speakers rarely use these inverted structures. They sound very formal and literary. You'll hear them more in news reports, academic writing, or when someone wants to sound more dramatic or sophisticated. In casual speech, people use normal word order: "I've never seen such terrible traffic" or "The manager rarely works from the office on Fridays."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Inversion with "Hardly/Scarcely/Barely... When"</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: hardly/scarcely/barely + had + subject + past participle (V3) + when + past simple clause</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: This structure shows that one event happened immediately after another. The first event (with "had") happened first, and the second event followed very quickly.</p>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Hardly</span> had the witness taken the stand when the defendant confessed.<br>(dramatic courtroom moment - the confession came immediately after)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Barely</span> had the results been announced when protests erupted across the capital.<br>(emphasising the immediate dramatic reaction in formal news reporting)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Hardly</span> had the CEO finished speaking when share prices began to fall.<br>(emphasising the immediate market reaction in formal financial reporting)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Inversion with "No Sooner... Than"</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: no sooner + had + subject + past participle (V3) + than + past simple clause</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: This structure is very similar to "hardly/scarcely/barely... when" but uses "than" instead of "when". It emphasises that something happened immediately after something else.</p>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">No sooner</span> had I got home than my phone started ringing.<br>(emphasising that the phone rang immediately when I arrived home)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">No sooner</span> had the minister finished his speech than he collapsed on stage.<br>(emphasising the shocking and unexpected timing of the collapse)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">No sooner</span> had we boarded the plane than the pilot announced a delay.<br>(emphasising the unfortunate timing of the delay announcement)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Inversion with "Not Only... But Also"</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: not only + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb, but (also) + normal clause</p>
        
        <p>The inversion only happens in the first clause (with "not only"). The second clause (with "but also") keeps normal word order.</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use this structure to add a second piece of information that is surprising or more important than the first. It creates emphasis by highlighting that two things are true, not just one.</p>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Not only</span> did she finish the report early, but she also presented it to the team.<br>(emphasising both the early completion and the additional presentation)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Not only</span> is the flat expensive, but it's also very small for the price.<br>(emphasising both negative aspects of the flat)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Not only</span> did we miss our flight, but the airline lost our bags as well.<br>(emphasising multiple problems with the travel experience)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Not only... but also" is one of the most commonly used inversions. Native speakers use it frequently to add emphasis or express surprise that two things happened or are true. Unlike other inversions, this one appears in both formal writing and everyday speech.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 5 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Inversion with "Under No Circumstances" and Similar Phrases</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: under no circumstances/at no time/on no account/in no way + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: These phrases strongly emphasise that something is absolutely not allowed or should never happen. They're very formal and often used in rules, warnings, or serious statements.</p>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Under no circumstances</span> should you share your company login details with anyone.<br>(a very strong warning about protecting login information)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">At no time</span> did anyone inform us that the museum was closed on Mondays.<br>(emphasising that we never received this important information)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">On no account</span> must passengers open the emergency exit during the flight.<br>(a very strong safety instruction about the emergency exit)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> These inversions are commonly used in warnings, rules, and formal complaints. They strongly emphasise that something should absolutely not happen or should never have happened. You'll hear them in safety announcements, company policies, and when people want to express strong disapproval.</p>

          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Think of inversion like question form: move the auxiliary verb before the subject. If there's no auxiliary, add "do/does/did".</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Remember: "hardly/scarcely/barely... when" BUT "no sooner... than". Don't mix them up!</p>

          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Inversion adds formality and emphasis. Use it in formal writing, presentations, and academic work, but not in casual conversation.</p>
