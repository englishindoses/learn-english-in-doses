      <h1>Mixed Modal Constructions</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mixed modal constructions combine modal verbs with perfect and/or continuous forms to express complex ideas about possibility, obligation, and likelihood in relation to different time frames. These advanced structures allow you to express nuanced meanings that simple modal verbs cannot convey alone.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Combine modal verbs with perfect forms to discuss past possibilities and probabilities.</li>
          <li>Use modals with continuous forms to express ongoing actions with modality.</li>
          <li>Create complex modal constructions to express precise meanings about hypothetical situations in different time frames.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Modal Verbs with Perfect Forms</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: modal + have + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: This construction refers to past time. It allows you to express possibility, certainty, obligation, or regret about something that happened (or didn't happen) in the past.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Must have finished</span> - They must have finished the project yesterday‚ÄîI saw the completed files in the shared folder. (expressing certainty about a past event)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Could have called</span> - You could have called me before coming over‚ÄîI wasn't home. (expressing a possibility in the past that didn't happen)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Shouldn't have spoken</span> - I shouldn't have spoken to the client like that. Now they're upset. (expressing regret about a past action)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual speech, native speakers often contract "have" with the modal. For example, "must have" becomes "must've," "could have" becomes "could've," and so on. Be careful not to write or say "must of," "could of," etc., which is a common mistake based on how these contractions sound.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Modal Verbs with Continuous Forms</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: modal + be + verb-ing</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: This construction refers to ongoing actions. It allows you to express possibility, certainty, or obligation about actions that are in progress or continuing over a period of time.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Must be working</span> - He must be working on the report right now. He's not answering his phone. (expressing certainty about a current ongoing action)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Should be studying</span> - She should be studying for her exam instead of watching TV. (expressing obligation related to an ongoing action)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Might be staying</span> - They might be staying at the Hilton hotel during their visit. (expressing possibility about an ongoing situation)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> These constructions are very common in everyday English, especially when making guesses about what people are doing at the moment. For example, "He's not answering. He must be sleeping."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 (if needed) -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Complex Modal Constructions (Perfect Continuous)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: modal + have + been + verb-ing</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: This most complex construction refers to ongoing actions in the past. It allows you to express possibility, obligation, or certainty about actions that were in progress up to a specific time in the past.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Must have been waiting</span> - They must have been waiting for hours before the train finally arrived. (expressing certainty about a past continuous action)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Could have been working</span> - I could have been working on more important tasks instead of attending that pointless meeting. (expressing a possible alternative continuous action in the past)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Should have been paying</span> - You should have been paying attention during the presentation. Now you've missed critical information. (expressing criticism about a past continuous action)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> While this complex form is grammatically correct and used in formal English, in casual conversation native speakers might use simpler forms or different expressions to convey similar meanings. For example, instead of "must have been working," they might say "I bet he was working" or "looks like he was working."</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Create a time-reference chart for modal constructions. When learning these complex forms, organize them by time (past, present, future) and aspect (simple, continuous, perfect). Make your own examples for each box in the chart and review them regularly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Practice the contraction forms (could've, might've, etc.) alongside the full forms to train your ear to distinguish them from the incorrect "could of" forms. Say them aloud and record yourself to check your pronunciation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Focus on one modal at a time. Instead of trying to master all mixed modal constructions at once, pick one modal (e.g., "must") and practice all its forms: must do, must have done, must be doing, must have been doing. Once comfortable, move to the next modal.</p>

          'q4': "We use 'might rain' to express possibility about a future action. The simple form is correct here because we're talking about a single event that could happen soon.",
          'q5': "We use 'must have been waiting' to express certainty about a continuous action in the past. Her tired appearance suggests an extended period of waiting.",
          'q6': "We use 'should have read' to express that something was advisable in the past but didn't happen. Missing a detail suggests the report wasn't read carefully enough.",
          'q7': "We use 'must leave' to express necessity in the future. The simple form is correct because we're talking about a single necessary action.",
          'q8': "We use 'might have been playing' to express possibility about a continuous action in the past. Their exhaustion suggests extended play as a possibility.",
          'q9': "We use 'would have purchased' in the result clause of a third conditional to express a hypothetical past result that didn't happen because the condition wasn't met.",
          'q10': "We use 'should be' to express that something is probably happening now based on the circumstances. The continuous form is implied by the context of 'preparing'."

          'q2': "We need a modal construction that expresses certainty about a completed action in the past. The other options either refer to the wrong time frame or have incorrect grammatical structures.",
          'q3': "We need a modal construction that expresses an unfulfilled obligation in the past. The team's loss suggests they should have done something differently, but didn't.",
          'q4': "We need a modal that expresses possibility about a future event. The clouds suggest rain as a possibility, but it hasn't happened yet, so we need the simple form.",
          'q5': "We need a modal construction that expresses certainty about a continuous action in the past. The context suggests Sarah was in the middle of waiting for an extended time.",
          'q6': "We need a modal construction that expresses an unfulfilled obligation in the past. The missed detail suggests the report should have been read more carefully, but wasn't.",
          'q7': "We need a modal that expresses necessity for a future action. Since we're talking about a single necessary action rather than a continuous one, the simple form is required.",
          'q8': "We need a modal construction that expresses possibility about a continuous action in the past. The exhaustion suggests extended play, and the structure needs both the perfect and continuous aspects.",
          'q9': "We need the correct form for the result clause in a third conditional sentence. This expresses what would have happened in the past if conditions had been different.",
          'q10': "We need a modal construction that expresses likelihood about a current ongoing action. Given the time and context, the chef is probably in the process of preparing to close."
