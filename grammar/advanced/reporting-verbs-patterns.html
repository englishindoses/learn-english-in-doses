      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When we report what people say, think, or do, we often use reporting verbs like "say" or "tell." However, English has many more specific reporting verbs that add extra meaning to what we report. These verbs show the speaker's attitude, intention, or the way something was communicated. Learning these patterns is essential for academic writing, professional communication, and understanding nuanced English in news and formal contexts.</p>

        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use advanced reporting verbs with the correct grammatical patterns (verb + to-infinitive, verb + object + to-infinitive, verb + verb-ing).</li>
          <li>Choose appropriate reporting verbs based on the speaker's intention or attitude.</li>
          <li>Transform direct speech into reported speech using a variety of sophisticated reporting verbs.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1: Reporting Verbs + To-Infinitive -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="grammar-summary">
        <h2>1. Reporting Verbs + To-Infinitive</h2>

        <p><strong>Form:</strong> subject + reporting verb + <span class="grammar-highlight">to-infinitive</span></p>

        <p><strong>Common verbs that follow this pattern:</strong> agree, decide, demand, offer, promise, refuse, threaten, claim, swear</p>

        <p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When reporting someone's intentions, decisions, or commitments.</li>
          <li>When the subject of the reporting verb is the same as the person doing the action.</li>
          <li>When you want to show determination, willingness, or refusal.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">agreed to help</span> with the project. <em>(She said yes when asked to help.)</em></li>
            <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">refused to answer</span> any questions. <em>(He said no when asked questions.)</em></li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">promised to deliver</span> the goods by Friday. <em>(The company said they would definitely deliver by Friday.)</em></li>
            <li>My colleague <span class="grammar-highlight">offered to cover</span> my shift. <em>(My colleague said he would work instead of me.)</em></li>
            <li>The witness <span class="grammar-highlight">claimed to have seen</span> the suspect. <em>(The witness said he saw the suspect, but we're not sure if it's true.)</em></li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Complete example with context:</strong></p>
        <p>After the meeting, the manager <span class="grammar-highlight">agreed to review</span> the proposal, but she <span class="grammar-highlight">refused to make</span> any promises about approval.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> The verb "claim" often suggests doubt. If you say "He claims to be an expert," you're implying you don't fully believe him.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2: Reporting Verbs + Object + To-Infinitive -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>2. Reporting Verbs + Object + To-Infinitive</h2>

        <p><strong>Form:</strong> subject + reporting verb + <span class="grammar-highlight">object</span> + <span class="grammar-highlight">to-infinitive</span></p>

        <p><strong>Common verbs that follow this pattern:</strong> advise, allow, ask, beg, convince, encourage, forbid, force, invite, order, permit, persuade, remind, tell, urge, warn</p>

        <p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When reporting that someone influenced another person's action.</li>
          <li>When there are two different people involved: the speaker and the person being spoken to.</li>
          <li>When reporting instructions, requests, or commands given to someone.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The doctor <span class="grammar-highlight">advised me to rest</span> for a few days. <em>(The doctor told me that resting would be good for me.)</em></li>
            <li>My boss <span class="grammar-highlight">encouraged me to apply</span> for the promotion. <em>(My boss said positive things to make me want to apply.)</em></li>
            <li>The police <span class="grammar-highlight">ordered the crowd to move</span> back. <em>(The police gave a command to the crowd.)</em></li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">persuaded him to change</span> his mind. <em>(She talked to him until he agreed to think differently.)</em></li>
            <li>The sign <span class="grammar-highlight">warned visitors not to feed</span> the animals. <em>(The sign told visitors this was dangerous or wrong.)</em></li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Complete example with context:</strong></p>
        <p>The travel agent <span class="grammar-highlight">advised us to book</span> early and <span class="grammar-highlight">reminded us to check</span> our passport expiry dates before travelling.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Tell" and "ask" are the most common verbs in this pattern in everyday speech. The others are used for more specific meanings.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3: Reporting Verbs + Verb-ing -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>3. Reporting Verbs + Verb-ing</h2>

        <p><strong>Form:</strong> subject + reporting verb + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span></p>

        <p><strong>Common verbs that follow this pattern:</strong> admit, deny, mention, recommend, regret, suggest</p>

        <p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When reporting actions or admissions without specifying who should do them.</li>
          <li>When the focus is on the action itself rather than the person doing it.</li>
          <li>Often used with verbs that express attitudes about past actions.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">admitted making</span> a mistake. <em>(She said yes, she made a mistake.)</em></li>
            <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">denied stealing</span> the money. <em>(He said he did not steal the money.)</em></li>
            <li>The guide <span class="grammar-highlight">recommended visiting</span> the museum early. <em>(The guide said visiting early would be a good idea.)</em></li>
            <li>My friend <span class="grammar-highlight">suggested trying</span> the new restaurant. <em>(My friend said the new restaurant might be good.)</em></li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">regret not listening</span> to your advice. <em>(I feel sorry that I didn't listen.)</em></li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Complete example with context:</strong></p>
        <p>When asked about the project failure, the team leader <span class="grammar-highlight">admitted underestimating</span> the timeline but <span class="grammar-highlight">denied ignoring</span> the warning signs.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Suggest" can also be followed by a that-clause: "She suggested that we try the new restaurant." Both patterns are correct.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4: Reporting Verbs + Object + Preposition + Verb-ing -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>4. Reporting Verbs + Object + Preposition + Verb-ing</h2>

        <p><strong>Form:</strong> subject + reporting verb + <span class="grammar-highlight">object</span> + <span class="grammar-highlight">preposition</span> + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span></p>

        <p><strong>Common verbs that follow this pattern:</strong> accuse (someone of), blame (someone for), congratulate (someone on), thank (someone for), warn (someone about/against)</p>

        <p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When reporting criticism, praise, or warnings that involve a specific person and action.</li>
          <li>When expressing cause and effect in reported speech.</li>
          <li>In formal writing or professional contexts.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The manager <span class="grammar-highlight">accused him of lying</span> about his qualifications. <em>(The manager said he lied about his qualifications.)</em></li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">blamed me for losing</span> the client. <em>(She said it was my fault that we lost the client.)</em></li>
            <li>My colleagues <span class="grammar-highlight">congratulated me on getting</span> the promotion. <em>(My colleagues said well done for getting the promotion.)</em></li>
            <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">thanked her for helping</span> with the presentation. <em>(He said thank you because she helped.)</em></li>
            <li>The financial advisor <span class="grammar-highlight">warned us against investing</span> all our savings. <em>(The advisor said this would be a bad idea.)</em></li>
          </ol>

        <p><strong>Complete example with context:</strong></p>
        <p>After the audit, the director <span class="grammar-highlight">accused the accountant of falsifying</span> records and <span class="grammar-highlight">blamed the supervisors for failing</span> to notice the errors.</p>

        <h2>Key Differences and Choosing Between Patterns</h2>

        <p><strong>How to choose the right pattern:</strong></p>

              <th>Verb</th>
              <th>Pattern</th>
              <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>suggest</td>
              <td>+ verb-ing</td>
              <td>She suggested leaving early.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>suggest</td>
              <td>+ that clause</td>
              <td>She suggested that we leave early.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>advise</td>
              <td>+ object + to-infinitive</td>
              <td>He advised me to wait.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>advise</td>
              <td>+ verb-ing (general advice)</td>
              <td>He advised waiting.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>recommend</td>
              <td>+ verb-ing</td>
              <td>I recommend booking in advance.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        </table>

        <p><strong>Important distinctions:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1. Promise vs. threaten:</strong> Both use + to-infinitive, but promise is positive and threaten is negative.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">promised to help</span>. <em>(positive commitment)</em></li>
          <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">threatened to resign</span>. <em>(negative consequence)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. Persuade vs. convince:</strong> Both mean to change someone's mind, but persuade always needs an object.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">persuaded him to stay</span>. ✓</li>
          <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">convinced him to stay</span>. ✓</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Deny vs. refuse:</strong> Deny is about facts (+ verb-ing). Refuse is about actions (+ to-infinitive).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">denied taking</span> the money. <em>(He said he didn't take it.)</em></li>
          <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">refused to take</span> the money. <em>(He said no when offered.)</em></li>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Group reporting verbs by their patterns and learn them together. Make flashcards with the verb on one side and its pattern + an example sentence on the other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> When you hear or read reported speech, notice which reporting verb is used and what pattern follows it. Keep a vocabulary notebook with new reporting verbs organised by pattern.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📝 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Remember that many reporting verbs carry attitude or emotion. "Insist" is stronger than "suggest." "Warn" is more urgent than "advise." Choosing the right verb makes your English more precise and natural.</p>
