      <h1>Double Passive Constructions</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
<section class="intro-section">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Double passive constructions occur when two passive structures are used together in the same sentence. These advanced grammatical forms are used in formal and academic writing to create complex and sophisticated expressions. While not common in everyday conversation, understanding double passives will help you comprehend academic texts and express complex ideas in formal writing.</p>
  
  <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognise and understand double passive constructions.</li>
    <li>Form double passives using different combinations of passive structures.</li>
    <li>Use double passives appropriately in formal and academic contexts.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>What Are Double Passive Constructions?</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: There are several possible combinations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Passive reporting verb + passive infinitive<br> (The book is believed to be written by Shakespeare.)</li>
    <li>Passive voice + passive relative clause<br> (The medicine was tested using methods that were approved by scientists.)</li>
    <li>Passive modal + passive infinitive (The form must be signed before it can be processed.)</li>
    <li>Passive causative structures<br> (The products were had tested before they were approved for sale.)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use double passive constructions when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing in a very formal or academic style, including news reports, research papers, or legal documents.</li>
    <li>Needing to emphasise the action and result, not the agent.</li>
    <li>Creating complex sentences where both actions need passive voice.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Double passives are rare in conversation but common in academic papers, news reports, and formal documents. They often sound too formal for everyday speech.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Passive Reporting Verb + Passive Infinitive</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This structure has been covered in detail in a previous lesson. For more information, see <a href="passive-reporting.html">passive-reporting.html</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>Form 1</strong>: subject + is/are + reporting verb in past participle (V3) + to be + past participle (V3)<br>
  <strong>When to use:</strong> For present or future actions/states.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Form 2</strong>: subject + is/are + reporting verb in past participle (V3) + to have been + past participle (V3)<br>
  <strong>When to use:</strong> For past actions or completed actions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Common reporting verbs</strong>: said, thought, believed, considered, reported, known, understood, expected</p>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The manuscript <span class="grammar-highlight">is believed to have been written</span> in the 15th century. (people think someone wrote this manuscript long ago)</li>
      <li>The bridge <span class="grammar-highlight">is expected to be completed</span> by next year. (people think the bridge will be finished in the future)</li>
      <li>The suspect <span class="grammar-highlight">is reported to have been seen</span> near the crime scene. (witnesses say they saw the suspect there in the past)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This is the most common type of double passive, especially in news reports and academic writing. Use the perfect infinitive (to have been + V3) for past events.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Passive Voice + Passive Relative Clause</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + be + past participle (V3) + relative pronoun + be + past participle (V3)</p>
  <div class="important-note">
  <strong>Remember</strong> that relative clauses can be reduced by leaving out the relative pronoun.</p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + be + past participle (V3) + past participle (V3) </p>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The problem <span class="grammar-highlight">was solved</span> using a method <span class="grammar-highlight">that was developed</span> by researchers at Oxford. (someone solved the problem using Oxford's method)</li>
      <li>Applications <span class="grammar-highlight">that are submitted</span> after the deadline <span class="grammar-highlight">are often rejected</span>. (late applications usually get refused)</li>
      <li>The building <span class="grammar-highlight">was renovated</span> using materials <span class="grammar-highlight">that were sourced</span> locally. (someone renovated the building with local materials)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This structure is common in technical and academic writing where multiple processes need to be described. The relative clause can come before or after the main clause.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Passive Modal + Passive Infinitive</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: modal + be + past participle (V3) + before/so that + passive structure</p>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The documents <span class="grammar-highlight">must be signed</span> before they <span class="grammar-highlight">can be processed</span> further. (signing is required for processing to happen)</li>
      <li>The application <span class="grammar-highlight">should be completed</span> so it <span class="grammar-highlight">can be considered</span> for the position. (completion is necessary for consideration)</li>
      <li>The equipment <span class="grammar-highlight">needs to be tested</span> before it <span class="grammar-highlight">is installed</span>. (testing is required before installation)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This structure is common in instructions and formal requirements where one action must happen before another can take place.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 5 -->
<section class="grammar-point">
  <h2>Passive Causative Structures</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Causative structures have been covered in a previous lesson. For more information, see <a href="causatives.html">causatives.html</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>What is a causative?</strong> A causative structure means you arrange for someone else to do something for you. With "have" or "get", you don't do the action yourself.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + have/get + object + past participle (V3) + before/so + passive structure</p>
  
  <p><strong>How it becomes double passive:</strong> The causative part uses passive voice (have/get something done), and the result is also passive (something is done).</p>
  
  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">had its products tested</span> before they <span class="grammar-highlight">were approved</span> for sale. (the company arranged testing, then authorities approved the products)</li>
      <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">got our proposal reviewed</span> so it <span class="grammar-highlight">could be submitted</span> on time. (we arranged for someone to review it, then it could be officially submitted)</li>
      <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">had her thesis examined</span> before it <span class="grammar-highlight">was published</span>. (she arranged for examination, then the journal published it)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Pure double passive causatives (like "had something done to be done") are very rare and sound unnatural. Native speakers prefer the structures shown above with connecting words like "before" or "so that".</p>

<!-- TIPS SECTION -->
<section class="tips">
  <h2 class="tips-heading">Useful Tips</h2>
  
  <div class="grammar-tip">
    <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Use double passives sparingly and mainly in formal or academic writing. In everyday communication, simpler structures are usually more effective.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="grammar-tip">
    <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> When using double passives, pay special attention to the tense relationships between the two passive forms to ensure logical and grammatical consistency.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="grammar-tip">
    <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> If a double passive construction sounds awkward or is difficult to understand, try using connecting words like "before", "so that", or "after" to make the relationship between the two actions clearer. In academic writing, passive voice is common, but clarity should always be the priority.</p>
