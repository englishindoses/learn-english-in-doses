      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Double passive constructions occur when two passive structures are used together in the same sentence. These advanced grammatical forms are used in formal and academic writing to create complex and sophisticated expressions. While not common in everyday conversation, understanding double passives will help you comprehend academic texts and express complex ideas in formal writing.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognise and understand double passive constructions</li>
          <li>Form double passives using different combinations of passive structures</li>
          <li>Use double passives appropriately in formal and academic contexts</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>What Are Double Passive Constructions?</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: There are several possible combinations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Passive reporting verb + passive infinitive</li>
          <li>Passive voice + passive relative clause</li>
          <li>Passive causative + passive main verb</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use double passive constructions when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing in a very formal or academic style</li>
          <li>Needing to emphasise the action and result, not the agent</li>
          <li>Creating complex sentences where both actions are in passive voice</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Double passives are rare in conversation but common in academic papers, legal documents, and formal reports. They often sound stilted if used in everyday speech.</p>
