      <h1>Subtle Differences Between Similar Modals</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Modal verbs in English can be challenging because there are subtle differences in meaning between similar modals like "might," "may," and "could." Using the right modal in the right context is important for clear and precise communication. This lesson will help you understand these subtle differences and choose the most appropriate modal for each situation.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the subtle differences between "may," "might," and "could" when expressing possibility.</li>
          <li>Distinguish between "should" and "ought to" for giving advice and expressing obligation.</li>
          <li>Choose correctly between "will" and "going to" for future predictions and intentions.</li>
          <li>Differentiate between "can" and "be able to" in various contexts.</li>
          <li>Use these modal verbs with greater precision in both speaking and writing.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="may-might">
        <h2>May vs. Might</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic Meaning</strong>: Both express possibility in the present or future.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>May</strong>: Suggests a stronger possibility (50-70% chance)</li>
          <li><strong>Might</strong>: Suggests a weaker possibility (30-50% chance)</li>
          <li><strong>May</strong> sounds more formal than <strong>might</strong></li>
          <li><strong>May</strong> is often used for permission in formal contexts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>It <span class="grammar-highlight">may rain</span> tomorrow. The forecast shows a 60% chance of rain. (stronger possibility)</li>
            <li>It <span class="grammar-highlight">might rain</span> tomorrow, but I'm not sure. (weaker possibility)</li>
            <li>Students <span class="grammar-highlight">may leave</span> when they finish the test. (formal permission)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">might go</span> to the cinema tonight, but I haven't decided yet. (uncertain plan)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In everyday conversation, native speakers use "might" much more frequently than "may" when discussing possibilities. "May" often sounds quite formal in casual contexts. You'll hear phrases like "I might go shopping later" rather than "I may go shopping later." When "may" is used in conversation, it's often in set phrases like "That may be true, but..." or in questions like "May I have another piece of cake?" where it's being used for permission rather than possibility.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="could-might">
        <h2>Could vs. Might</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic Meaning</strong>: Both express possibility, but with different nuances.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Could</strong>: Often suggests ability or capability within the possibility</li>
          <li><strong>Might</strong>: Simply suggests that something is possible</li>
          <li><strong>Could</strong> can refer to theoretical possibilities</li>
          <li><strong>Might</strong> often implies uncertainty about actual outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">could speak</span> Japanese when she was younger. (past ability)</li>
            <li>This treatment <span class="grammar-highlight">could work</span> for your condition. (theoretical possibility with some evidence)</li>
            <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">might arrive</span> late tonight - his flight is often delayed. (uncertain situation)</li>
            <li>The project <span class="grammar-highlight">could be completed</span> by Friday if everyone works efficiently. (conditional possibility)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In real conversations, "could" is often used when suggesting options or ideas: "We could try that new restaurant on High Street" or "You could ask your boss for a day off." When discussing uncertainties, especially ones we feel somewhat anxious about, "might" is common: "He might be angry with me" or "The interview might not go well." The differences are subtle, and often the choice depends more on the speaker's intuition about what sounds right in a given context rather than strict rules.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="should-ought-to">
        <h2>Should vs. Ought to</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic Meaning</strong>: Both express advisability, recommendation, or obligation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Should</strong>: More common and less formal</li>
          <li><strong>Ought to</strong>: More formal and slightly stronger in terms of obligation</li>
          <li><strong>Should</strong>: Sometimes expresses expectation</li>
          <li><strong>Ought to</strong>: Often implies moral obligation or what is the right thing to do</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>You <span class="grammar-highlight">should eat</span> more vegetables. (general advice)</li>
            <li>You <span class="grammar-highlight">ought to tell</span> the truth. (moral obligation)</li>
            <li>The train <span class="grammar-highlight">should arrive</span> in about ten minutes. (expectation)</li>
            <li>People <span class="grammar-highlight">ought to respect</span> each other's differences. (moral principle)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Should" is far more common in everyday speech than "ought to," which can sound a bit old-fashioned or formal. When giving casual advice to friends, you'll almost always hear "You should try the pasta there" rather than "You ought to try the pasta." "Ought to" tends to appear more in formal contexts or when discussing moral obligations: "Companies ought to take responsibility for their environmental impact." In questions and negatives, "should" is much more common: "Should I call her?" rather than "Ought I to call her?"</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="will-going-to">
        <h2>Will vs. Going to</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic Meaning</strong>: Both express future events.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Will</strong>: Expresses spontaneous decisions, promises, and predictions based on opinion</li>
          <li><strong>Going to</strong>: Expresses planned decisions and predictions based on present evidence</li>
          <li><strong>Will</strong>: More formal in some contexts</li>
          <li><strong>Going to</strong>: Can sound more conversational</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>It's very cold. I <span class="grammar-highlight">will close</span> the window. (spontaneous decision made at the moment of speaking)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">am going to visit</span> my parents this weekend. (planned decision made before the moment of speaking)</li>
            <li>I think she <span class="grammar-highlight">will pass</span> the exam. (prediction based on opinion/belief)</li>
            <li>Look at those clouds! It <span class="grammar-highlight">is going to rain</span>. (prediction based on present evidence)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In conversation, native speakers often use "will" and "going to" quite flexibly, sometimes interchangeably. "I'll see you tomorrow" and "I'm going to see you tomorrow" might be used in the same situation. However, for immediate reactions and spontaneous offers, "will" is much more natural: "That bag looks heavy. I'll help you with it." For planned actions, especially in casual conversation, "going to" is very common and often contracted to "gonna" in speech: "What are you gonna do this weekend?" The contracted form of "will" ('ll) is extremely common in speech: "I'll call you later."</p>
        </div>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 5 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="can-be-able-to">
        <h2>Can vs. Be able to</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Basic Meaning</strong>: Both express ability.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Can</strong>: Expresses general ability and is more common in everyday speech</li>
          <li><strong>Be able to</strong>: Can express ability in all tenses (past, present, future)</li>
          <li><strong>Can</strong>: Only has present and past (could) forms</li>
          <li><strong>Be able to</strong>: Often emphasizes achievement or success in doing something</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">can swim</span>. (general ability)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">was able to swim</span> across the lake yesterday. (specific achievement)</li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">can speak</span> three languages. (general ability)</li>
            <li>After many years of practice, she <span class="grammar-highlight">will be able to perform</span> at Carnegie Hall next month. (future ability/achievement)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In everyday conversation, "can" is much more common than "be able to" for simple abilities: "I can drive" rather than "I am able to drive." "Be able to" is often used when "can" isn't grammatically possible, like after "will" or in perfect tenses: "I will be able to help you tomorrow" or "She hasn't been able to sleep lately." For specific achievements in the past, especially ones involving difficulty, "was/were able to" often sounds more natural: "Despite the storm, we were able to make it home safely." This emphasizes the successful completion of a challenging task.</p>

      <section class="grammar-point" id="comparative-examples">
        <h2>Comparative Examples: Choosing the Right Modal</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Context matters</strong>: The right modal often depends on the specific context and the precise meaning you want to convey.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these examples:</strong></p>
          <ol>

            <span class="grammar-highlight">Can I</span> use your phone? (informal request for permission)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Could I</span> use your phone? (polite request for permission)</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">It might rain</span> tomorrow. (lower probability, quite uncertain)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">It may rain</span> tomorrow. (moderate probability)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">It could rain</span> tomorrow. (conditional possibility, depending on weather conditions)</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">You should go</span> to the doctor. (advice, recommendation)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">You ought to go</span> to the doctor. (stronger advice, implying it's the right thing to do)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">You must go</span> to the doctor. (strong obligation or necessity)</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">I'll call</span> you tomorrow. (spontaneous decision or promise)<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">I'm going to call</span> you tomorrow. (planned action decided before speaking)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Even native English speakers sometimes use these modals interchangeably in casual conversation, especially "might" and "could" for possibility. The context, tone of voice, and accompanying adverbs (like "possibly," "definitely," "probably") often give clues to the intended meaning. When in doubt about which modal to use in a formal context, "may" and "should" are usually safe choices as they're broadly accepted in both formal and semi-formal situations.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> When unsure between "will" and "going to," think about when the decision was made. If you're deciding at the moment of speaking, use "will." If you decided earlier, use "going to."</p>
