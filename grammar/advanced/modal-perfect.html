      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Modal perfect forms combine modal verbs with "have" and a past participle to talk about possibilities, abilities, obligations, or conclusions about past situations. These forms help us express what could, should, or might have happened in the past but didn't, as well as our certainty about past events.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form and use "must have + past participle" to make deductions about the past.</li>
          <li>Use "could have + past participle" to express past possibilities that didn't happen.</li>
          <li>Apply "should have + past participle" to discuss past obligations or better choices.</li>
          <li>Use "may/might have + past participle" to express uncertainty about past events.</li>
          <li>Form "would have + past participle" to talk about hypothetical past situations.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="must-have">
        <h2>Must have + past participle</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Must + have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: We use "must have + past participle" to make deductions or express strong certainty about past situations. It shows we're almost certain that something happened based on available evidence. It expresses a logical conclusion about the past.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">must have forgotten</span> about our meeting. She's never this late. (Based on the evidence of her lateness, I'm almost certain she forgot.)</li>
            <li>John <span class="grammar-highlight">must have worked</span> all night. The report is on my desk and it's over 30 pages long. (The evidence of the completed report makes me sure he worked all night.)</li>
            <li>They <span class="grammar-highlight">must have arrived</span> home by now. Their flight landed three hours ago. (Based on the time that's passed, I'm logically concluding they're home.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use "must have" when they want to emphasize that they're quite certain about why something happened. For example, if someone finds their plants looking healthy after being away, they might say: "My neighbour must have watered my plants while I was on holiday." This is more emphatic than saying "I think my neighbour watered my plants." You'll also hear phrases like "must have been" in expressions of sympathy: "That must have been difficult for you."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="could-have">
        <h2>Could have + past participle</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Could + have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: We use "could have + past participle" to talk about past possibilities that didn't happen‚Äîthings that were possible but didn't occur. It can express unrealized abilities, missed opportunities, or alternative actions that were possible in the past.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">could have won</span> the match if our best player hadn't been injured. (Winning was a possibility that didn't happen.)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">could have finished</span> the project yesterday, but I decided to watch a movie instead. (I had the ability to finish but chose not to.)</li>
            <li>You <span class="grammar-highlight">could have called</span> me to say you were going to be late. (It was possible for you to call, but you didn't.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Could have" is commonly used in complaints or when expressing regret or disappointment. You might hear a parent tell their teenager: "You could have let me know you were staying at your friend's house!" In conversation, it's often contracted, sounding like "could've" or even "coulda" in very casual speech. The tone of voice usually indicates whether the speaker is emphasizing a missed opportunity or expressing criticism.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="should-have">
        <h2>Should have + past participle</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Should + have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: We use "should have + past participle" to express regret about past actions or to indicate what would have been a better choice or the right thing to do in the past. It suggests an unfulfilled expectation, obligation, or recommendation.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">should have studied</span> harder for the exam. I failed because I was unprepared. (It would have been better if I'd studied harder.)</li>
            <li>You <span class="grammar-highlight">should have told</span> me about the meeting. I missed important information. (It was expected that you would tell me, but you didn't.)</li>
            <li>They <span class="grammar-highlight">should have arrived</span> by now. I'm getting worried something's wrong. (I expected them to arrive, but they haven't.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Should have" is frequently used for self-criticism or to give criticism to others about past actions. In everyday conversation, you'll often hear it contracted as "should've" or even "shoulda" in very informal speech. People commonly use this structure when giving advice in hindsight: "You should have asked for a discount" or when expressing regret: "I shouldn't have eaten so much cake." The negative form "shouldn't have" is just as common and is used to talk about actions that happened but were unwise.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="may-might-have">
        <h2>May/Might have + past participle</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: May/Might + have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: We use "may have" or "might have + past participle" to express uncertainty about past events. It indicates a possibility that something happened in the past, but we're not sure. "Might have" suggests a slightly lower possibility than "may have."</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">may have missed</span> the train. That's why she's not here yet. (It's possible that she missed the train, but I'm not certain.)</li>
            <li>They <span class="grammar-highlight">might have gone</span> to the restaurant across the street. Let's check there. (Perhaps they went there, but I'm quite uncertain.)</li>
            <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">may have forgotten</span> to send the email. It's worth asking him again. (It's possible he forgot, but I can't be sure.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In everyday speech, "might have" is more common than "may have" when speculating about past events. When people are offering possible explanations for something, you'll often hear: "She might have taken the day off" or "It might have been delivered to the wrong address." These forms are used a lot in detective shows when characters are trying to solve mysteries: "The killer might have entered through the window."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 5 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="would-have">
        <h2>Would have + past participle</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Would + have + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: We use "would have + past participle" to talk about hypothetical situations in the past‚Äîthings that didn't happen but we can imagine the outcome if they had. It's often used in conditional sentences to describe the result of an unfulfilled condition.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If I had known about the traffic, I <span class="grammar-highlight">would have left</span> earlier. (I didn't know about the traffic, so I didn't leave earlier.)</li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">would have helped</span> you if you had asked. (You didn't ask, so she didn't help you.)</li>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">would have gone</span> to the concert if we'd had tickets. (We didn't have tickets, so we didn't go.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Would have" is very common in everyday conversation, especially when people talk about regrets or when considering how things might have been different. You'll hear expressions like: "I would have bought those shoes, but they didn't have my size" or "We would have visited you, but we were too busy." In speech, it's usually contracted to "would've" or even "would'a" in very casual conversation. It's often used with "if only" to express wishes about the past: "If only we'd known, we would have done things differently."</p>
        </div>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 6 - Key differences/Choosing between forms -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="differences">
        <h2>Key Differences: Choosing the Right Modal Perfect Form</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Key differences</strong>: Choosing between modal perfect forms depends on what aspect of the past situation you want to emphasize:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Must have</strong>: Strong logical conclusion about the past (high certainty)</li>
          <li><strong>Could have</strong>: Unrealized possibility or ability in the past</li>
          <li><strong>Should have</strong>: Unfulfilled obligation or better alternative in the past</li>
          <li><strong>May/Might have</strong>: Uncertainty about past events (may = medium possibility, might = lower possibility)</li>
          <li><strong>Would have</strong>: Hypothetical results of conditions that weren't met in the past</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these examples:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Must have been</span> tired: I'm sure she was tired because she fell asleep immediately.<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Could have been</span> tired: Perhaps she was tired, or perhaps she was bored (one possibility among others).<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Should have been</span> tired: It would have been appropriate for her to be tired after all that work.</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Must have left</span> early: Based on the evidence, I'm certain they left early.<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Might have left</span> early: It's possible they left early, but I'm not sure.<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Would have left</span> early: If something had happened, they would have left early (but they didn't).</li>
            
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Could have passed</span> the exam: He had the ability to pass but didn't.<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Should have passed</span> the exam: It was expected that he would pass, or he ought to have passed.<br>
            <span class="grammar-highlight">Might have passed</span> the exam: Perhaps he passed, but I'm not sure yet.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual conversation, native speakers sometimes use these modal perfect forms in ways that overlap slightly. For example, "You must have been working hard" and "You must have been tired" sound like conclusions, but they're often used as sympathetic comments with the real meaning "I understand that you were working hard/were tired." Context and tone of voice often help clarify the intended meaning.</p>

          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Remember that after every modal (must, could, should, might, etc.), we always use the base form "have," never "has" or "had." Then we add the past participle of the main verb (e.g., gone, done, seen).</p>
        </div>

          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> To remember the difference between "could have" and "should have," think about possibility versus advice. "Could have" means it was possible but didn't happen; "should have" suggests it would have been better if something had happened.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> When using "would have," remember it's usually part of a third conditional sentence, often with an "if clause" (using "if + had + past participle"). For example: "If I had studied harder (condition), I would have passed the exam (result)."</p>
