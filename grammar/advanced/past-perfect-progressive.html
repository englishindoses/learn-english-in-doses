      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Both the Past Perfect Progressive and Past Perfect tenses are used to talk about actions that happened before another time in the past. However, they focus on different aspects of these actions. Understanding the difference between these tenses will help you express past events more precisely in both writing and speaking.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form and use both the Past Perfect Progressive and Past Perfect correctly</li>
          <li>Understand when to choose one tense over the other</li>
          <li>Identify the subtle differences in meaning between these two tenses</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Perfect: Form and Basic Use</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + had + past participle</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <strong>had finished</strong> her report before the meeting started.</li>
            <li>We <strong>had visited</strong> Rome three times before we moved there.</li>
            <li>By the time he arrived, the train <strong>had left</strong>.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: The Past Perfect emphasizes the <em>completion</em> of an action before another time in the past. We use it when:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The result or completion of the action was important</li>
          <li>We want to highlight that something was finished before another past event</li>
          <li>We're talking about an experience that was completed before a past time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual conversation, native speakers sometimes use simple past instead of past perfect, especially when the sequence of events is clear from context. However, in professional or academic writing, using past perfect correctly is important.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Perfect Progressive: Form and Basic Use</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + had been + verb-ing</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <strong>had been working</strong> on the project for six months before she was promoted.</li>
            <li>We <strong>had been waiting</strong> for the bus for 20 minutes when it finally arrived.</li>
            <li>His eyes were red because he <strong>had been crying</strong>.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: The Past Perfect Progressive emphasizes the <em>duration</em> or <em>ongoing nature</em> of an action before another time in the past. We use it when:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>We want to focus on how long an activity continued up to a past moment</li>
          <li>We're explaining the cause of something in the past (especially with physical states or visible results)</li>
          <li>We want to emphasize the ongoing activity rather than its completion</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This tense often appears with time expressions like "for two hours," "since morning," or "all day" to emphasize the duration of the action.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Key Differences and Choosing Between the Two Tenses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Focus on completion vs. process</strong>:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>Past Perfect: <em>When we arrived, she <strong>had prepared</strong> dinner.</em> (The preparation was complete)</p>
          <p>Past Perfect Progressive: <em>When we arrived, she <strong>had been preparing</strong> dinner.</em> (She was in the process of preparing dinner)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Emphasis on duration vs. result</strong>:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>Past Perfect Progressive: <em>I <strong>had been studying</strong> Spanish for five years before I moved to Madrid.</em> (Emphasizes the duration)</p>
          <p>Past Perfect: <em>I <strong>had studied</strong> Spanish before I moved to Madrid.</em> (Emphasizes the completed action/result)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Explaining visible results or conditions</strong>:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p>Past Perfect Progressive: <em>The ground was wet because it <strong>had been raining</strong>.</em> (Explains the visible result)</p>
          <p>Past Perfect: <em>It <strong>had rained</strong> earlier that day before we went out.</em> (Simply states a completed action)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> When explaining why something looked a certain way in the past, native speakers often prefer the Past Perfect Progressive: "He was exhausted because he had been working all night."</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="tips-heading">How to Remember and Practice</h2>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>Memory Tip:</strong> Think of Past Perfect as a "completion" tense (had + completed action) and Past Perfect Progressive as a "duration" tense (had been + ongoing action).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>Practice Exercise 1:</strong>Practice with your daily life: Write about a day last week, using Past Perfect for completed tasks and Past Perfect Progressive for ongoing activities. "I woke up late because I had forgotten to set my alarm clock. By the time I got to the meeting, my client had been waiting for 20 minutes. He wasn't happy!"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>Practice Exercise 2:</strong> Write your own story about a mysterious situation using Past Perfect Progressive to build suspense about ongoing actions and Past Perfect to reveal completed actions. For example: "When I entered the room, someone had been cooking (smell, mess), but they had already left (completed action)."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>Practice Exercise 3:</strong> Make a list of state verbs (know, believe, want, etc.) and action verbs (work, run, study, etc.). Practice creating sentences with state verbs in Past Perfect and action verbs in both Past Perfect and Past Perfect Progressive to understand the difference in meaning.</p>
