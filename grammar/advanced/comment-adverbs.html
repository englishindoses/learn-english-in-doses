      <h1>Comment Adverbs and Attitude Markers</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Comment adverbs are words that express the speaker's opinion, attitude, or judgement about an entire sentence. Unlike most adverbs, which describe how, when, or where something happens, comment adverbs tell you what the speaker thinks or feels about what they are saying. Words like <em>unfortunately</em>, <em>apparently</em>, <em>obviously</em>, and <em>frankly</em> are all comment adverbs. They are very common in both formal and informal English, and learning to use them will help you express your opinions and attitudes more precisely.</p>

        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use comment adverbs to express your opinion or attitude about a whole sentence.</li>
          <li>Choose the correct comment adverb based on the attitude or judgement you want to convey.</li>
          <li>Position comment adverbs correctly in a sentence.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 1: Attitude Comment Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Attitude Comment Adverbs</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">comment adverb</span> + comma + clause (front position) OR subject + <span class="grammar-highlight">comment adverb</span> + verb (mid position)</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Attitude comment adverbs express the speaker's feelings about the situation described in the sentence. They tell the listener whether the speaker considers something good, bad, lucky, unlucky, or surprising.</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unfortunately</strong> — the speaker feels the situation is bad or regrettable.</li>
          <li><strong>Fortunately</strong> / <strong>luckily</strong> — the speaker feels the situation is good or lucky.</li>
          <li><strong>Surprisingly</strong> — the speaker did not expect this.</li>
          <li><strong>Sadly</strong> — the speaker feels sorrow about the situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Happily</strong> — the speaker is pleased about the situation. (Be careful: <em>happily</em> can also be a manner adverb meaning "in a happy way." Context makes the difference clear.)</li>
          <li>These adverbs usually go in <strong>front position</strong> followed by a comma, but can also go in <strong>mid position</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Unfortunately,</span> the last train to the airport had already left.<br>(= the speaker feels this is bad news.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Surprisingly,</span> the cheapest hotel had the best reviews.<br>(= the speaker did not expect this.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Luckily,</span> we found a taxi just in time for the meeting.<br>(= the speaker feels relieved.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In spoken English, native speakers often use these adverbs at the start of a response to signal their feelings immediately. For example: "Unfortunately, no" or "Surprisingly, yes." This is a natural and efficient way to communicate attitude.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 2: Certainty and Evidence Comment Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Certainty and Evidence Comment Adverbs</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">comment adverb</span> + comma + clause (front position) OR subject + <span class="grammar-highlight">comment adverb</span> + verb (mid position)</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: These comment adverbs express how certain the speaker is about the truth of what they are saying, or how they came to know the information. They are very useful in academic writing, journalism, and professional communication.</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apparently</strong> — the speaker has heard or read this, but is not completely sure it is true. It suggests second-hand information.</li>
          <li><strong>Clearly</strong> / <strong>obviously</strong> — the speaker believes this is easy to see or understand. The evidence is strong.</li>
          <li><strong>Evidently</strong> — similar to <em>apparently</em>, but slightly more formal. It suggests there is evidence for the claim.</li>
          <li><strong>Undoubtedly</strong> — the speaker is very certain. There is no doubt in their mind.</li>
          <li><strong>Presumably</strong> — the speaker assumes this is true based on logic, but does not have direct confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Apparently,</span> the company is planning to open a new office abroad.<br>(= the speaker has heard this but is not certain.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Clearly,</span> we need to change our approach if we want better results.<br>(= the speaker believes this is obvious.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Presumably,</span> the flight will be delayed because of the storm.<br>(= the speaker is making a logical assumption.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 3: Honesty and Speaking Style Comment Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Honesty and Speaking Style Comment Adverbs</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">comment adverb</span> + comma + clause (front position)</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: These comment adverbs tell the listener how the speaker is choosing to communicate. They signal honesty, directness, or a particular speaking style. They are most common in spoken English and informal writing.</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frankly</strong> — the speaker is being very direct and honest, possibly saying something others might not want to hear.</li>
          <li><strong>Honestly</strong> — the speaker is emphasising that they are telling the truth.</li>
          <li><strong>Seriously</strong> — the speaker wants the listener to take the statement seriously.</li>
          <li><strong>Personally</strong> — the speaker is giving their own individual opinion, which may differ from others.</li>
          <li><strong>Strictly speaking</strong> — the speaker is being technically precise, even if the reality is more flexible.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Frankly,</span> the project is behind schedule and we need to act now.<br>(= the speaker is being very direct.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Personally,</span> I think the earlier flight is a better option.<br>(= this is the speaker's individual opinion.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Strictly speaking,</span> you need a permit to park here, but nobody checks.<br>(= technically true, but not enforced in practice.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 4: Position of Comment Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Position of Comment Adverbs</h2>

        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Comment adverbs are flexible in their position, but each position creates a slightly different effect. Understanding these positions will help you use comment adverbs naturally.</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Front position</strong> (before the subject) — the most common position. The comment adverb sets the tone for the whole sentence. It is usually followed by a comma.</li>
          <li><strong>Mid position</strong> (between the subject and verb, or after the first auxiliary) — slightly less common. The comment feels more integrated into the sentence.</li>
          <li><strong>End position</strong> (at the end of the sentence) — the least common for comment adverbs. It is sometimes used for afterthoughts or in informal speech.</li>
          <li>Front position is the safest and most natural choice for most comment adverbs.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Obviously,</span> we need more time to finish the report.<br>(= front — sets the tone immediately.)</li>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">obviously</span> need more time to finish the report.<br>(= mid — sounds slightly more casual.)</li>
            <li>We need more time to finish the report, <span class="grammar-highlight">obviously</span>.<br>(= end — sounds like an afterthought or adds emphasis.)</li>
          </ol>

      <section class="tips">
        <h2 class="tips-heading">Useful Tips</h2>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Think of comment adverbs as "meta-language" — they are not part of the sentence's factual content but tell the listener how you feel about it. When you remove a comment adverb, the factual meaning of the sentence stays the same. This is a useful test: if removing the adverb changes the facts, it is probably not a comment adverb.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Build a personal collection of comment adverbs organised by attitude: positive (<em>fortunately, happily</em>), negative (<em>unfortunately, sadly</em>), surprise (<em>surprisingly, remarkably</em>), and certainty (<em>clearly, obviously, apparently</em>). Having this mental toolkit ready will help you react quickly in conversations and express yourself more naturally.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Listen to English news broadcasts and notice how presenters use comment adverbs to signal their reporting stance. Phrases like "apparently," "reportedly," and "presumably" are used constantly to show how certain the speaker is about the information. This is an excellent way to hear comment adverbs used naturally in context.</p>
