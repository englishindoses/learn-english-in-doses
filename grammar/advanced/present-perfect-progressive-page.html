      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Both Present Perfect Progressive and Present Perfect Simple connect past actions to the present moment, but they focus on different aspects of the action. Understanding when to use each tense will help you express yourself more precisely and sound more natural in English.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the key differences between Present Perfect Progressive and Present Perfect Simple</li>
          <li>Use both tenses correctly in conversations and writing</li>
          <li>Choose the right tense based on your communication purpose</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect Simple: Form and Usage</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + have/has + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>Main uses</strong>: The Present Perfect Simple emphasises completed actions, results, achievements, and experiences up to the present moment.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <strong>have finished</strong> my homework. (The homework is now complete)</li>
            <li>She <strong>has visited</strong> Paris three times. (Emphasis on the experience and how many times)</li>
            <li>They <strong>have lived</strong> in London for five years. (They still live there)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use Present Perfect Simple with time expressions like "just," "already," "yet," "ever," and "never". Example: "I've just eaten lunch" or "Have you ever visited Spain?"</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect Progressive: Form and Usage</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + have/has + been + verb-ing</p>
        
        <p><strong>Main uses</strong>: The Present Perfect Progressive emphasises the ongoing nature, duration, or temporary nature of an action that started in the past and continues to the present.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <strong>have been studying</strong> English for three years. (Focus on the ongoing activity)</li>
            <li>She <strong>has been waiting</strong> for the bus for 30 minutes. (Emphasises the duration and that she's still waiting)</li>
            <li>They <strong>have been working</strong> on this project since January. (The action is still in progress)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use Present Perfect Progressive to explain a current situation, especially when there are visible results or when someone looks tired/busy: "Sorry about the mess. I've been painting the kitchen."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Choosing Between the Two Tenses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Key differences</strong>: Your choice depends on what aspect of the action you want to emphasise.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Compare these pairs:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>I <strong>have read</strong> three books this week. (Completed action, focus on result - three finished books)</li>
            <li>I <strong>have been reading</strong> this book all week. (Ongoing activity, focus on the process - still reading)</li>
            <br>
            <li>She <strong>has cleaned</strong> the house. (Focus on result - the house is now clean)</li>
            <li>She <strong>has been cleaning</strong> the house. (Focus on the activity itself, may not be finished)</li>
            <br>
            <li>They <strong>have lived</strong> here for 10 years. (Simple state, focus on the whole period)</li>
            <li>They <strong>have been living</strong> here for 10 years. (More emphasis on the ongoing situation)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> With some verbs like "live," "work," and "teach," native speakers often use both forms interchangeably: "I've worked here for five years" and "I've been working here for five years" are both natural.</p>

          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Ask yourself what you want to focus on: if it's the result or completion of an action, use Present Perfect Simple. If it's the process, duration, or ongoing nature, use Present Perfect Progressive.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Pay attention to time expressions: "already," "yet," "ever," and "never" are commonly used with Present Perfect Simple, while "for," "since," "all day/week," and "lately" are often used with Present Perfect Progressive.</p>
