      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In English, not only can main verbs be passive, but infinitives and gerunds can also take passive forms. Passive infinitives and gerunds allow us to express complex ideas while maintaining the focus on the receiver of an action, especially in formal or academic contexts. These advanced structures are essential for sophisticated expression in English.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form and use passive infinitives correctly (to be + past participle)</li>
          <li>Form and use passive gerunds properly (being + past participle)</li>
          <li>Identify contexts where passive infinitives and gerunds are appropriate</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Passive Infinitives</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: to be + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use passive infinitives when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The infinitive verb needs to be in passive voice</li>
          <li>The focus is on the receiver of the action</li>
          <li>Following verbs, adjectives, or nouns that require an infinitive</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The new employees expect <span class="grammar-highlight">to be trained</span> properly during the first week. (After expect)</li>
            <li>The documents need <span class="grammar-highlight">to be signed</span> by tomorrow morning. (After need)</li>
            <li>It's important <span class="grammar-highlight">to be vaccinated</span> before travelling to certain countries. (After adjective)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Passive infinitives often follow these verbs: want, need, expect, hope, would like, deserve, arrange. They also commonly follow "it + adjective" structures like "it's important/necessary/vital to be...".</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Passive Gerunds</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: being + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use passive gerunds when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The gerund verb needs to be in passive voice</li>
          <li>The action is happening to the subject</li>
          <li>Following prepositions or verbs that require a gerund</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She hates <span class="grammar-highlight">being photographed</span> at family gatherings. (After the verb "hate")</li>
            <li>The suspect denied <span class="grammar-highlight">being seen</span> near the crime scene. (After the verb "deny")</li>
            <li>We worry about <span class="grammar-highlight">being judged</span> by others too often. (After the preposition "about")</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Passive gerunds often follow verbs of emotion (like, dislike, hate, love), reporting verbs (deny, admit, mention), and prepositions (about, of, on).</p>
        </div>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->

        <h2>Special Structures with Passive Infinitives</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Various special constructions</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: These special structures have specific meanings and uses.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Worth + being + past participle (V3) OR worth + gerund (with passive meaning):</strong></p>

            <li>This book is worth <span class="grammar-highlight">being read</span>. / This book is worth <span class="grammar-highlight">reading</span>. (Both have passive meaning)</li>
            <li>The issue is worth <span class="grammar-highlight">being discussed</span>. / The issue is worth <span class="grammar-highlight">discussing</span>.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Need + passive infinitive OR need + gerund (with passive meaning):</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>These shirts need <span class="grammar-highlight">to be ironed</span>. / These shirts need <span class="grammar-highlight">ironing</span>.</li>
            <li>The car needs <span class="grammar-highlight">to be washed</span>. / The car needs <span class="grammar-highlight">washing</span>.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Deserve + passive infinitive:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>She deserves <span class="grammar-highlight">to be promoted</span> for her hard work.</li>
            <li>This achievement deserves <span class="grammar-highlight">to be celebrated</span>.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> With structures like "need + -ing" (e.g., "The car needs washing"), native speakers often use the -ing form rather than "to be + past participle" in casual speech. Both forms are correct, but the -ing form is more concise.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> With verbs like "need" and "require", you have a choice between "needs to be done" and "needs doing" - both have passive meaning, but the second form is more informal and common in everyday speech.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> When deciding between active and passive forms, ask yourself: "Who or what is performing the action?" If the receiver of the action is more important, use passive.</p>
