      <h1>Subjunctive Mood</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p>The subjunctive mood is a special verb form used to express wishes, suggestions, demands, hypothetical situations, and emotions. Unlike the indicative mood (which states facts), the subjunctive expresses ideas that are not necessarily real or factual. In English, the subjunctive appears in formal writing, fixed expressions, and certain grammatical structures.</p>

        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the present subjunctive correctly after verbs of suggestion, demand, and recommendation.</li>
          <li>Apply the past subjunctive to express hypothetical and contrary-to-fact situations.</li>
          <li>Recognise and use subjunctive forms in formal expressions and fixed phrases.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Subjunctive</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + suggest/recommend/demand/insist/require + that + subject + base form of verb</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the present subjunctive after certain verbs that express suggestions, demands, requirements, or recommendations. The subjunctive clause usually begins with "that."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common verbs followed by present subjunctive:</strong> suggest, recommend, demand, insist, require, request, propose, advise, urge</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>My manager <span class="grammar-highlight">suggests that I work</span> overtime this week. (expressing a recommendation)</li>
            <li>The travel guide <span class="grammar-highlight">recommends that she book</span> her hotel early. (expressing advice)</li>
            <li>The university <span class="grammar-highlight">requires that all students submit</span> their essays by Friday. (expressing a requirement)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">insist that he be</span> more careful when driving. (expressing a demand)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In informal speech, many native speakers use the normal indicative form instead of the subjunctive: "I suggest that he studies harder." However, in formal writing, business contexts, and academic English, the subjunctive is preferred and expected.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Subjunctive</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: if + subject + were + (verb-ing/adjective/noun) OR subject + wish + subject + were + (verb-ing/adjective/noun)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the past subjunctive to express hypothetical or unreal situations. It appears commonly in second conditionals and after "wish."</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>If I <span class="grammar-highlight">were you</span>, I would take that job offer. (giving advice about what to do in your situation)</li>
            <li>I wish I <span class="grammar-highlight">were on holiday</span> in Spain right now. (expressing desire for something that isn't happening)</li>
            <li>If she <span class="grammar-highlight">were working</span> here, she would help us with this project. (imagining an unreal work situation)</li>
            <li>If we <span class="grammar-highlight">were living</span> in the city centre, we could walk to work. (imagining a different living situation and its benefits)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual speech, many native speakers say "If I was you..." instead of "If I were you..." But "were" is more correct and always used in the fixed phrase "If I were you."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Subjunctive in Formal Expressions</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Fixed expressions using base form of verbs</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: The subjunctive appears in many formal expressions, legal language, and traditional phrases. These are often fixed expressions that must be memorised.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Long live the Queen!</span> (Traditional expression - note "live," not "lives")</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Be that as it may</span>, we still need to finish the project. (Formal expression meaning "even so")</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Come what may</span>, we'll face it together. (Fixed expression meaning "whatever happens")</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Far be it from me</span> to criticise your work. (Formal expression meaning "I don't want to")</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Suffice it to say</span> that the meeting didn't go well. (Formal expression meaning "it's enough to say")</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
         <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> These formal expressions are more common in writing than in speech. They may be used sometimes when speaking in formal situations or to add style/drama to speech. In everyday conversation, native speakers often use alternative constructions: "Suffice it to say..." -> "Let's just say..."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Subjunctive with "Wish" and "If only"</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: 
        <br>‚Ä¢ subject + wish + subject + past tense (for present situations)
        <br>‚Ä¢ subject + wish + subject + had + past participle (V3) (for past situations) 
        <br>‚Ä¢ subject + wish + subject + would + base form (for future actions/complaints)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the subjunctive after "wish" and "if only" to express regret, desires for different circumstances, or impossible wishes.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I wish I <span class="grammar-highlight">had more free time</span> for cooking. (Wish about current situation)</li>
            <li>If only I <span class="grammar-highlight">were travelling</span> to Italy right now. (Strong wish about current situation)</li>
            <li>I wish I <span class="grammar-highlight">had taken</span> that job in New York. (Regret about past decision)</li>
            <li>If only we <span class="grammar-highlight">had booked</span> our holiday earlier. (Regret about past action)</li>
            <li>I wish my flatmate <span class="grammar-highlight">would wash</span> the dishes more often. (Request for future change)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "I wish" + past subjunctive is very common in everyday English. Native speakers use this structure regularly to express dissatisfaction with current situations or to talk about hypothetical scenarios. "If only" is more dramatic and emotional than "I wish."</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Listen for subjunctive patterns in formal news broadcasts, business presentations, and academic lectures. News reporters often use phrases like "The government demands that all citizens be vaccinated" or "Experts recommend that people avoid large gatherings."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Create memory cards for the most common subjunctive triggers: suggest, recommend, demand, insist, require. Practice making sentences with "that" clauses after each verb, always using the base form of the following verb.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Remember that "If I were you" is one of the most common subjunctive expressions in English. Native speakers use this phrase constantly to give advice. Master this phrase first, then expand to other hypothetical "were" constructions.</p>
