      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The present perfect is one of the most versatile and nuanced tenses in English. Beyond its basic uses for experiences, recent past events, and unfinished time periods, the present perfect has several advanced applications that can add sophistication and precision to your English.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the present perfect in sophisticated ways that go beyond basic uses.</li>
          <li>Distinguish between subtle meanings created by present perfect in different contexts.</li>
          <li>Apply advanced present perfect structures in formal and informal settings.</li>
          <li>Understand native-like usage of present perfect with stative verbs, adverbials, and in special contexts.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="grammar-summary">
        <h2>Present Perfect for Implied Results</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + have/has + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Beyond just connecting past to present, the present perfect can imply important present consequences or results without explicitly stating them.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">I've left</span> my laptop at home." (Implied result: I don't have it now/I can't work)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">She's broken</span> her ankle." (Implied result: She can't walk properly now)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">We've missed</span> the train." (Implied result: We need to find alternative transport)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use this structure to indirectly request help or explain a current problem. When someone says "I've lost my keys," they're usually implying "Can you help me find them?" rather than just stating a fact.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect with Stative Verbs</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + have/has + past participle of stative verbs (know, understand, believe, etc.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: With stative verbs (verbs that describe states rather than actions), the present perfect often emphasizes the continuing relevance of a state that began in the past.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">I've always known</span> that this project would be challenging." (Knowledge that continues from past to present)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">She's believed</span> in the importance of education since childhood." (Continuing belief)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">We've understood</span> the problem for some time now." (Understanding that began in the past and continues)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> With stative verbs, native speakers rarely use the continuous form (e.g., "I've been knowing"). Instead, they use the simple present perfect, even when talking about long periods: "I've known him for twenty years" (not "I've been knowing him").</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect with Specific Adverbials</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + have/has + past participle + adverbial (just, already, yet, still, etc.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Certain adverbials give the present perfect specific nuances that add precision to your communication.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"She <span class="grammar-highlight">has just arrived</span>." (Very recent past, happened moments ago)</li>
            <li>"I <span class="grammar-highlight">have already finished</span> the report." (Completed sooner than expected)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">Have</span> you <span class="grammar-highlight">seen</span> the new film <span class="grammar-highlight">yet</span>?" (Expectation that it will happen eventually)</li>
            <li>"He <span class="grammar-highlight">still hasn't replied</span> to my email." (Expectation unfulfilled, with some frustration)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In British English, "just," "already," and "yet" are typically used with the present perfect, while American English sometimes uses them with the past simple: "Did you eat yet?" (US) vs. "Have you eaten yet?" (UK). Both forms are widely understood.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect for News and Recent Events</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + have/has + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: The present perfect is often used to announce news or report recent events, especially in headlines, news broadcasts, and formal announcements.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"Scientists <span class="grammar-highlight">have discovered</span> a new species in the Amazon rainforest." (Recent news with current relevance)</li>
            <li>"The government <span class="grammar-highlight">has announced</span> new economic measures." (Recent announcement with ongoing implications)</li>
            <li>"The team <span class="grammar-highlight">has won</span> the championship for the third time." (Recent achievement worth noting)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> News headlines often drop the auxiliary verb "have/has" to save space: "Scientists discovered new species" instead of "Scientists have discovered new species." However, in the actual article or when speaking, the present perfect is typically used.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 5 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect for "Never" and "Ever" Contexts</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + have/has + never/ever + past participle</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: The present perfect with "never" and "ever" is used to talk about experiences (or lack thereof) up to the present moment, often with emotional emphasis or to express surprise.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"I <span class="grammar-highlight">have never seen</span> anything like it." (Emphasizing uniqueness of current situation)</li>
            <li>"<span class="grammar-highlight">Have</span> you <span class="grammar-highlight">ever visited</span> Japan?" (Asking about life experience up to now)</li>
            <li>"This <span class="grammar-highlight">has never happened</span> before." (Emphasizing unusualness of current situation)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In informal speech, native speakers sometimes use "never" with present perfect for dramatic effect or to strongly deny a recent accusation: "I've never said that!" (even when referring to a specific time in the past).</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 6 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Present Perfect vs. Present Perfect Continuous</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <br>Present Perfect: Subject + have/has + past participle<br>Present Perfect Continuous: Subject + have/has + been + present participle (-ing)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use which</strong>: The choice between these forms creates subtle differences in meaning. The simple form (present perfect) tends to emphasize results or completeness, while the continuous form emphasizes duration, process, or temporary situations.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>"I <span class="grammar-highlight">have read</span> three books this week." (Emphasizes completion, counting the books) vs. "I <span class="grammar-highlight">have been reading</span> a lot this week." (Emphasizes the activity itself)</li>
            <li>"She <span class="grammar-highlight">has written</span> the report." (Emphasizes that the report is now complete) vs. "She <span class="grammar-highlight">has been writing</span> the report all day." (Emphasizes the ongoing process)</li>
            <li>"They <span class="grammar-highlight">have lived</span> in London for ten years." (State, emphasizes the whole time period) vs. "They <span class="grammar-highlight">have been living</span> in a hotel since the flood." (Temporary situation)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> With some verbs (especially stative verbs like "know," "be," "have"), native speakers strongly prefer the simple form: "I've known him for years" (not "I've been knowing him"). With action verbs, both forms are possible but create different nuances.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Think of the present perfect as a lens that looks at the past from the perspective of the present. It's always about how past events matter now.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Listen for contextual clues when native speakers use the present perfect without time adverbials. Often, they're implying results or news relevance rather than just describing past actions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> When deciding between present perfect simple and continuous, ask yourself: "Am I emphasizing the result or completion (simple) or the process and duration (continuous)?"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> For stative verbs (know, understand, believe, etc.), create a memory hook: "States stay simple" to remember that we usually avoid continuous forms with these verbs, even in perfect tenses.</p>
