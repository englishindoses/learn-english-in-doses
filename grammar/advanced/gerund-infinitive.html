      <h1>Gerund vs Infinitive: Verbs with Meaning Changes</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Some verbs in English can be followed by either a gerund (verb-ing) or an infinitive (to + verb), but the meaning changes depending on which form you use. Understanding these differences is essential for precise communication, as choosing the wrong form can completely change the meaning.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Distinguish between the different meanings of key verbs when followed by gerund or infinitive.</li>
          <li>Choose the correct form (gerund or infinitive) based on your intended meaning.</li>
          <li>Use these verb patterns accurately in context.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1: STOP -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="stop">
        <h2>Stop</h2>
        
        <h3>Stop + verb-ing</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To finish or quit an activity permanently or for a period of time.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: stop + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>He <strong>stopped smoking</strong> five years ago.<br>(= He quit the habit completely.)</li>
            <li>Can you <strong>stop making</strong> that noise? I'm trying to concentrate.<br>(= Please don't do that anymore.)</li>
            <li>It's <strong>stopped raining</strong>. Let's go outside.<br>(= The rain has finished.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Stop + to-infinitive</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To pause one activity in order to do something else.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: stop + <span class="grammar-highlight">to + verb</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>We <strong>stopped to get</strong> petrol on the way to the airport.<br>(= We paused our journey to get petrol.)</li>
            <li>She <strong>stopped to answer</strong> her phone during the meeting.<br>(= She paused what she was doing to take the call.)</li>
            <li>I <strong>stopped to admire</strong> the view from the top of the hill.<br>(= I paused my walk to look at the scenery.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is one of the most commonly confused pairs. "He stopped smoking" means he quit cigarettes. "He stopped to smoke" means he paused what he was doing to have a cigarette – the complete opposite!</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2: REMEMBER & FORGET -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="remember-forget">
        <h2>Remember & Forget</h2>
        
        <p>These two verbs are opposites, but the meaning change between gerund and infinitive works in the same way for both.</p>

        <h3>Remember / Forget + verb-ing</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To have (or not have) a memory of something that happened in the past.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: remember/forget + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <strong>remember locking</strong> the door before I left.<br>(= I have a clear memory of doing this.)</li>
            <li>I'll <strong>never forget seeing</strong> the Northern Lights for the first time.<br>(= This memory will stay with me forever.)</li>
            <li>Do you <strong>remember meeting</strong> him at Sarah's party?<br>(= Do you have a memory of this?)</li>
            <li>She'll <strong>never forget visiting</strong> Japan. It was an amazing trip.<br>(= The experience is unforgettable.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Remember / Forget + to-infinitive</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To not forget (or to fail) to do a task or duty.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: remember/forget + <span class="grammar-highlight">to + verb</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>Please <strong>remember to send</strong> the report by Friday.<br>(= Don't forget to do this task.)</li>
            <li>I <strong>forgot to buy</strong> milk on the way home.<br>(= I didn't remember to do this task.)</li>
            <li>Did you <strong>remember to book</strong> the restaurant?<br>(= Did you do this task you were supposed to do?)</li>
            <li>Don't <strong>forget to turn off</strong> the lights when you leave.<br>(= Remember to do this.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Forget + verb-ing" is almost always used with "never" in the positive form: "I'll never forget visiting Paris." We rarely say "I forget visiting Paris" – instead, we'd say "I don't remember visiting Paris."</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3: TRY -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="try">
        <h2>Try</h2>
        
        <h3>Try + verb-ing</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To experiment with something to see if it works or helps.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: try + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>Have you <strong>tried restarting</strong> your computer?<br>(= Have you tried this solution?)</li>
            <li><strong>Try adding</strong> a bit more salt to the soup.<br>(= Do this to see if it tastes better.)</li>
            <li>If you can't sleep, <strong>try drinking</strong> some warm milk before bed.<br>(= Drink warm milk to see if it helps you sleep.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Try + to-infinitive</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To make an effort or attempt to do something difficult.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: try + <span class="grammar-highlight">to + verb</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <strong>tried to open</strong> the window, but it was stuck.<br>(= I made an effort but couldn't do it.)</li>
            <li>She's <strong>trying to learn</strong> Japanese, but it's very challenging.<br>(= She's making an effort to do something difficult.)</li>
            <li>We <strong>tried to contact</strong> you, but your phone was off.<br>(= We attempted to reach you.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> When giving advice about solutions, we use "try + verb-ing": "Try turning it off and on again." When talking about difficult attempts, we use "try + to-infinitive": "I tried to fix it myself, but I couldn't."</p>
        </div>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4: REGRET -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="regret">

        <h3>Regret + verb-ing</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To feel sorry about something you did (or didn't do) in the past.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: regret + <span class="grammar-highlight">verb-ing</span></p>

            <li>Do you <strong>regret leaving</strong> your previous job?<br>(= Do you regret your decision?)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Regret + to-infinitive</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: To feel sorry about what you are about to say (formal). Used to deliver bad news politely.</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: regret + <span class="grammar-highlight">to + verb</span></p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>We <strong>regret to inform</strong> you that your application has been unsuccessful.<br>(= We are sorry, but your application was not successful.)</li>
            <li>I <strong>regret to say</strong> that the event has been cancelled.<br>(= I'm sorry about the sad news I'm announcing.)</li>

          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Regret + to-infinitive" is quite formal and is typically used in official announcements, formal letters, or professional communication. In everyday speech, we'd simply say "I'm sorry to tell you that..."</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 1:</strong> With "stop", ask yourself: "Did the activity end?" If yes, use verb-ing. "Did I pause to do something?" If yes, use to-infinitive.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Think about time. With "remember" and "forget", the gerund refers to the PAST (something that already happened), while the infinitive refers to the FUTURE (something you need to do).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> With "try", think about the context: Is it a suggestion for a solution? Use verb-ing. Is it a difficult attempt? Use to-infinitive.</p>
