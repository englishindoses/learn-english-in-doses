      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Focusing adverbs are small but powerful words that draw the listener's or reader's attention to a specific part of a sentence. Words like <em>only</em>, <em>even</em>, <em>just</em>, <em>especially</em>, and <em>mainly</em> help you highlight exactly what you mean. These adverbs are extremely common in both spoken and written English, but their meaning changes depending on where you place them in a sentence. Learning to use them accurately will help you communicate more precisely.</p>

        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use focusing adverbs to highlight specific parts of a sentence.</li>
          <li>Position focusing adverbs correctly to express your intended meaning.</li>
          <li>Choose between different focusing adverbs to add emphasis, limit meaning, or express surprise.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 1: Restrictive Focusing Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Restrictive Focusing Adverbs: Only, Just, Merely</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">focusing adverb</span> + the word or phrase being focused on</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Restrictive focusing adverbs limit the meaning of a sentence to one specific thing. They say "this and nothing else" or "this and no more." The most common ones are <em>only</em>, <em>just</em>, and <em>merely</em>. Place them directly before the word or phrase you want to focus on.</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Only</strong> — the most common restrictive focusing adverb. It limits the sentence to one particular element.</li>
          <li><strong>Just</strong> — similar to <em>only</em>, but slightly more informal.</li>
          <li><strong>Merely</strong> — similar to <em>only</em>, but more formal. It often downplays the importance of something.</li>
          <li>The <strong>position</strong> of the focusing adverb changes the meaning. Place it directly before the element you want to restrict.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">only</span> eats vegetables on weekdays.<br>(= she does nothing else with vegetables — she eats them. She does not grow them or sell them.)</li>
            <li>She eats <span class="grammar-highlight">only</span> vegetables on weekdays.<br>(= she eats vegetables and nothing else — no meat, no fish.)</li>
            <li>She eats vegetables <span class="grammar-highlight">only</span> on weekdays.<br>(= she does this on weekdays and at no other time.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual speech, native speakers often place <em>only</em> and <em>just</em> in mid position regardless of what they are focusing on, and rely on spoken stress to make the meaning clear. In writing, position matters much more because the reader cannot hear your emphasis.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 2: Additive Focusing Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Additive Focusing Adverbs: Also, Too, As Well, Even</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">focusing adverb</span> + the word or phrase being added</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Additive focusing adverbs tell the reader that something is being added to what is already known or expected. They say "this too" or "in addition to what you already know."</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Also</strong> — goes in mid position (before the main verb or after the first auxiliary verb). Used in both formal and informal English.</li>
          <li><strong>Too</strong> — goes at the end of a sentence or clause. Used in informal and neutral English.</li>
          <li><strong>As well</strong> — goes at the end of a sentence. Similar to <em>too</em> and used in the same way.</li>
          <li><strong>Even</strong> — adds something surprising or unexpected. It goes directly before the word or phrase it focuses on.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She speaks French and she <span class="grammar-highlight">also</span> speaks Japanese.<br>(= Japanese is an additional language.)</li>
            <li>He visited the museum and the art gallery <span class="grammar-highlight">too</span>.<br>(= the gallery is added to the museum.)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">Even</span> the manager was surprised by the results.<br>(= it is surprising that the manager was surprised — you would not expect this.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 3: Particularising Focusing Adverbs -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Particularising Focusing Adverbs: Especially, Particularly, In Particular</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">especially / particularly / in particular</span> + the word, phrase, or clause being highlighted</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: These focusing adverbs single out one thing from a group and give it extra importance. They say "above all" or "more than the others."</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Especially</strong> — highlights one item as more important or relevant than others.</li>
          <li><strong>Particularly</strong> — similar to <em>especially</em> and can be used interchangeably in most cases.</li>
          <li><strong>In particular</strong> — used as a phrase, usually after a comma or at the end of a clause. Slightly more formal.</li>
          <li>These adverbs often appear after a general statement to narrow the focus.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The food was excellent, <span class="grammar-highlight">especially</span> the seafood.<br>(= the seafood stood out from the rest.)</li>
            <li>The course is useful for all employees, <span class="grammar-highlight">particularly</span> those in management roles.<br>(= management employees benefit the most.)</li>
            <li>Several cities in Italy are worth visiting. Florence, <span class="grammar-highlight">in particular,</span> is beautiful in spring.<br>(= Florence is singled out from the group.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 4: Focusing Adverbs for Emphasis -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Focusing Adverbs for Emphasis: Mainly, Mostly, Largely, Primarily</h2>

        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <span class="grammar-highlight">mainly / mostly / largely / primarily</span> + the word, phrase, or clause being emphasised</p>
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: These adverbs indicate that something is true for the most part, but not entirely. They say "to the greatest extent" or "for the majority."</p>

        <p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mainly</strong> — used to say something is true for the biggest part.</li>
          <li><strong>Mostly</strong> — very similar to <em>mainly</em>. Slightly more informal.</li>
          <li><strong>Largely</strong> — more formal. Used to say something is true to a great extent.</li>
          <li><strong>Primarily</strong> — the most formal of this group. Often used in academic and professional writing.</li>
          <li>These adverbs go in mid position (before the main verb) or at the start of a phrase they modify.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The team <span class="grammar-highlight">mainly</span> works on international accounts.<br>(= this is what they do most of the time.)</li>
            <li>The delay was <span class="grammar-highlight">largely</span> due to problems with the supplier.<br>(= this was the biggest reason.)</li>
            <li>The conference is <span class="grammar-highlight">primarily</span> aimed at healthcare professionals.<br>(= they are the main target audience.)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT 5: Key Differences -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Key Differences</h2>

        <p>Focusing adverbs have different functions, and choosing the right one depends on what you want to communicate.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Restrictive</strong> (<em>only, just, merely</em>) — limits the meaning: "this and nothing else."</li>
          <li><strong>Additive</strong> (<em>also, too, even</em>) — adds information: "this as well" or "this is surprising."</li>
          <li><strong>Particularising</strong> (<em>especially, particularly</em>) — singles out one from a group: "this one above all."</li>
          <li><strong>Emphasis</strong> (<em>mainly, mostly, largely</em>) — describes the majority: "this for the most part."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Compare these sentences:</p>

        <div class="example">
          <ul>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">only</span> invited colleagues.<br>(= nobody else — no friends, no family.)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">also</span> invited colleagues.<br>(= in addition to other people I already invited.)</li>
            <li>I invited colleagues, <span class="grammar-highlight">especially</span> those from my department.<br>(= my department colleagues are highlighted.)</li>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">mainly</span> invited colleagues.<br>(= most guests were colleagues, but perhaps a few others too.)</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="tips">
        <h2 class="tips-heading">Useful Tips</h2>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 1:</strong> To check if you have placed <em>only</em> or <em>just</em> correctly, ask yourself: "What exactly am I restricting?" Then place the adverb directly before that word. Read the sentence aloud to check if the meaning is what you intended. If you can move <em>only</em> to a different position and the sentence means the same thing, it might be in the wrong place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Remember that <em>even</em> always signals surprise. Before using it, ask: "Would this be unexpected?" If the answer is no, choose <em>also</em> or <em>too</em> instead. A good test is to imagine someone raising their eyebrows — if they would not, <em>even</em> is probably not the right word.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>📌 <strong>TIP 3:</strong> When writing formal reports or essays, use <em>particularly</em>, <em>in particular</em>, or <em>primarily</em> instead of <em>especially</em> and <em>mainly</em>. They carry the same meaning but sound more professional. This small change can make a noticeable difference in the tone of your writing.</p>
