      <h1>Narrative Tenses</h1>

      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Narrative tenses are past tenses used to tell stories, describe past events, and show the relationship between different actions in the past. Using these tenses correctly helps your listener or reader understand when events happened in relation to each other.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use past simple, past continuous, and past perfect correctly in storytelling.</li>
          <li>Understand the sequence of events in a narrative by recognizing different past tenses.</li>
          <li>Create more sophisticated narratives by combining different past tenses.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Simple</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + past form of the verb (V2)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the past simple for completed actions in the past. It's the most common narrative tense and forms the backbone of most stories.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">arrived</span> at the office at 9 am yesterday. (A specific completed action)</li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">visited</span> her grandmother every Sunday. (Regular past habit)</li>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">took</span> three flights to reach our destination. (Sequence of completed actions)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers often use the past simple for almost all past events, even when other past tenses might be more precise. It's the default tense for telling stories.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Continuous</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + was/were + verb-ing</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the past continuous for actions that were in progress at a specific moment in the past or actions that were interrupted by another action (usually in past simple).</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">was working</span> when my boss called. (Action in progress interrupted by another action)</li>
            <li>At 3 pm yesterday, she <span class="grammar-highlight">was studying</span> for her exam. (Action in progress at a specific time)</li>
            <li>While we <span class="grammar-highlight">were travelling</span> through Spain, we visited many beautiful cities. (Background action during which other actions occurred)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> The past continuous is often used to set the scene in stories: "It <span class="grammar-highlight">was raining</span> heavily, and the wind <span class="grammar-highlight">was blowing</span> the trees." This creates a vivid backdrop for the main events.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Past Perfect</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: Subject + had + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use the past perfect for actions that happened before another action in the past. It shows the order of events clearly when you're not telling a story in chronological order.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>By the time I arrived, the meeting <span class="grammar-highlight">had already started</span>. (The meeting started before I arrived)</li>
            <li>She was nervous because she <span class="grammar-highlight">had never flown</span> before. (The lack of flying experience happened before the nervousness)</li>
            <li>When we reached the cinema, the film <span class="grammar-highlight">had finished</span>. (The film finished before we reached the cinema)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> While the past perfect is important for clarity, native speakers sometimes replace it with past simple when the order of events is obvious from context or when time expressions like "already," "just," or "before" make the sequence clear.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Combining Narrative Tenses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>When to combine tenses</strong>: To create a rich, clear narrative, you'll often need to use all three tenses together to show the relationship between events.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I <span class="grammar-highlight">was reading</span> (past continuous) a book when the phone <span class="grammar-highlight">rang</span> (past simple). I <span class="grammar-highlight">had forgotten</span> (past perfect) to turn off the sound.</li>
            <li>When Sarah <span class="grammar-highlight">arrived</span> (past simple) at the party, John <span class="grammar-highlight">was dancing</span> (past continuous) with someone else. She <span class="grammar-highlight">had hoped</span> (past perfect) he would wait for her.</li>
            <li>The police <span class="grammar-highlight">discovered</span> (past simple) that the thief <span class="grammar-highlight">had entered</span> (past perfect) through the back door. An alarm <span class="grammar-highlight">was ringing</span> (past continuous) when they arrived.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> When telling stories, native speakers often switch between tenses naturally to create drama or emphasize certain events. Past continuous is used for setting the scene, past simple for main events, and past perfect for explaining backstory.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> Visualize a timeline to help decide which tense to use. Place all events on the timeline, then use past perfect for events that came before your main narrative point, past continuous for actions in progress, and past simple for completed actions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> Use time markers to help clarify the sequence of events: "already," "just," "yet," "before," "after," "by the time," and "when" can help make the relationship between events clearer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Practice storytelling by rewriting simple news articles using all three narrative tenses. Start with the main event in past simple, add background in past continuous, and earlier events in past perfect.</p>
