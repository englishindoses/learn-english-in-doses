      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Relative clauses are parts of a sentence that provide additional information about a noun. They are introduced by relative pronouns like who, which, that, whose, and whom. In advanced English, mastering the different types of relative clauses and knowing when to use them allows you to create more complex and precise sentences.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Distinguish between defining and non-defining relative clauses and use them correctly.</li>
          <li>Use relative clauses with prepositions in both formal and informal contexts.</li>
          <li>Create reduced relative clauses to make your speech and writing more concise.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="defining-relative-clauses">
        <h2>Defining Relative Clauses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: noun + who/which/that/whose/whom + subject/verb + rest of clause</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use defining relative clauses to provide essential information about a noun. This information is <strong>necessary to identify</strong> exactly which person or thing you are talking about. Defining relative clauses are <strong>not</strong> separated by commas.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The woman <span class="grammar-highlight">who lives next door</span> is a doctor. (Identifies which woman we're talking about)</li>
            <li>The book <span class="grammar-highlight">that I bought yesterday</span> is very interesting. (Identifies which book)</li>
            <li>The car <span class="grammar-highlight">whose engine failed</span> had to be towed away. (Identifies which car)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1.2 -->
<section class="grammar-point" id="omitting-relative-pronouns">
  <h2>Omitting Relative Pronouns</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Form for object pronouns</strong>: noun + subject + verb + rest of clause (no relative pronoun)</p>
  <p><strong>Form for subject pronouns</strong>: noun + who/which/that + verb + rest of clause (pronoun required)</p>
  
  <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: You can omit the relative pronoun (who, which, that) in <strong>defining</strong> relative clauses, but <strong>only</strong> when the relative pronoun is the <strong>object</strong> of the verb in the relative clause, not when it's the subject.</p>
  
  <div class="example">
    <p><strong>When the relative pronoun is the object (can be omitted):</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The book <span class="grammar-highlight">(that)</span> I bought yesterday is interesting. (Object: I bought the book)</li>
      <li>The person <span class="grammar-highlight">(who/whom/that)</span> we met at the conference works for Google. (Object: we met the person)</li>
      <li>The movie <span class="grammar-highlight">(which/that)</span> they recommended was excellent. (Object: they recommended the movie)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>When the relative pronoun is the subject (cannot be omitted):</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The woman <span class="grammar-highlight">who/that</span> lives next door is a doctor. (Subject: the woman lives next door)</li>
      <li>The car <span class="grammar-highlight">which/that</span> broke down has been repaired. (Subject: the car broke down)</li>
      <li>The students <span class="grammar-highlight">who/that</span> passed the exam received certificates. (Subject: the students passed the exam)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In conversational English, native speakers almost always drop the relative pronoun when it's the object, especially in informal situations. This omission makes speech sound more natural and fluent. In writing, especially formal writing, the pronoun is more often retained.</p>
  </div>
</section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="non-defining-relative-clauses">
        <h2>Non-Defining Relative Clauses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: noun + , + relative pronoun + subject/verb + rest of clause + , + rest of the sentence</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use non-defining relative clauses to add extra information about a noun that is already identified. This information is <strong>not essential</strong> for identifying the noun. Non-defining relative clauses are always separated by commas, and you cannot use 'that' as a relative pronoun.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>My sister, <span class="grammar-highlight">who lives in Paris</span>, is visiting next week. (Extra information about "my sister" who is already identified)</li>
            <li>The Eiffel Tower, <span class="grammar-highlight">which was built in 1889</span>, is the symbol of Paris. (Extra information about "the Eiffel Tower")</li>
            <li>Dr. Smith, <span class="grammar-highlight">whose research has been widely published</span>, will give a lecture tomorrow. (Extra information about "Dr. Smith")</li>
            <li>My uncle, <span class="grammar-highlight">whom I admire greatly</span>, is a retired lawyer. (Expressing admiration for my uncle)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> You might hear people use 'that' in non-defining clauses in casual speech, but it is considered incorrect in standard English and should be avoided in writing or exams.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="relative-clauses-prepositions">
        <h2>Relative Clauses with Prepositions</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form (informal)</strong>: noun + who/which/that + subject + verb + rest of clause + preposition</p>
        <p><strong>Form (formal)</strong>: noun + preposition + whom/which + subject + verb + rest of clause</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use these structures when the relationship between the noun and the relative clause involves a preposition (to, for, with, about, etc.). The first structure is more common in informal English, while the second is more formal.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Informal (ending with preposition):</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The person <span class="grammar-highlight">who I was talking to</span> is my colleague. (To whom I was talking)</li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">that we work for</span> is expanding. (For which we work)</li>
            <li>The issue <span class="grammar-highlight">which they are concerned about</span> needs urgent attention. (About which they are concerned)</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Formal (preposition before relative pronoun):</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The person <span class="grammar-highlight">to whom I was talking</span> is my colleague.</li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">for which we work</span> is expanding.</li>
            <li>The issue <span class="grammar-highlight">about which they are concerned</span> needs urgent attention.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Native speakers almost always use the informal structure with the preposition at the end. To make it less formal in casual speech, they use 'that' as the relative pronoun.<br>
             The formal structure with the preposition before the relative pronoun sounds very formal and is mainly used in academic writing, legal documents, or very formal speech.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point" id="reduced-relative-clauses">
        <h2>Reduced Relative Clauses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: There are two main types of reduced relative clauses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Active:</strong> <em>noun + present participle (verb-ing)</em><br>
    Used when the original clause is in the active voice.<br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> The man <span class="grammar-highlight">talking to Sarah</span> is my teacher.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Passive:</strong> <em>noun + past participle (V3)</em><br>
    Used when the original clause is in the passive voice.<br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> The book <span class="grammar-highlight">written by Tolkien</span> is very famous.
  </li>
</ul>

        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use reduced relative clauses to make your speech or writing more concise by omitting the relative pronoun and sometimes the verb "be". They can only be used with defining relative clauses, not with non-defining ones.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
  <p><strong>Original vs. Reduced Relative Clauses:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Original: The woman <span class="grammar-highlight">who is standing</span> by the window is my teacher.<br>
      Reduced: The woman <span class="grammar-highlight">standing</span> by the window is my teacher.
      <em>(Active reduction: "who is" removed)</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Original: The document <span class="grammar-highlight">that was sent</span> yesterday has arrived.<br>
      Reduced: The document <span class="grammar-highlight">sent</span> yesterday has arrived.
      <em>(Passive reduction: "that was" removed)</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Original: The people <span class="grammar-highlight">who live</span> in that house are very friendly.<br>
      Reduced: The people <span class="grammar-highlight">living</span> in that house are very friendly.
      <em>(Active reduction: "who" removed and verb changed to "-ing" form)</em>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> Reduced relative clauses are very common in both spoken and written English as they make communication more efficient. Native speakers often use them naturally without thinking about the grammar rules, especially with common verbs like "called," "named," "born," etc. For example, "The boy called John" instead of "The boy who is called John."</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> To determine whether to use a defining or non-defining relative clause, ask yourself: "Is this information necessary to identify which person/thing I'm talking about?" If yes, use a defining clause (no commas). If no, use a non-defining clause (with commas).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
        <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong><strong> How to tell subject from object:</strong> Look at what follows the relative pronoun:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there's another subject (like I, you, he, she, they, we, or a name) after the relative pronoun, then the pronoun is the object and can be dropped. Example: "The book (that) <strong>I</strong> bought..." (I = subject)</li>
      <li>If there's a verb directly after the relative pronoun with no intervening subject, then the pronoun is the subject and cannot be dropped. Example: "The woman who <strong>lives</strong> next door..." (lives = verb, no other subject)</li>
    </ul>  
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> Practice reducing relative clauses to make your English more fluent and natural. Look for clauses with "who is/are" and "which is/are" as these are the easiest to reduce.</p>
