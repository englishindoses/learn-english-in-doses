      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Relative clauses help us give more information about a noun. They are like adding extra details to your sentence. We use them to make our English more precise and to join two sentences together in a more elegant way.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand and use both defining and non-defining relative clauses</li>
          <li>Choose and use the correct relative pronouns (who, which, that, etc.)</li>
          <li>Form relative clauses with prepositions correctly</li>
          <li>Create reduced relative clauses to make your English more concise</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Defining Relative Clauses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: We place the relative clause directly after the noun it describes, without commas, using relative pronouns (who, which, that, whose, whom, where, when)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: A defining relative clause gives essential information about a noun. This information is necessary to understand which person or thing we are talking about.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">The woman who lives next door</span> is a doctor. (Specifies which woman)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">The book that I bought yesterday</span> is very interesting. (Specifies which book)</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-highlight">The city where I was born</span> has changed a lot. (Specifies which city)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: A non-defining relative clause gives extra information about a noun. This information is not essential - we could remove it and still understand which person or thing is being talked about.</p>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Relative Clauses with Prepositions</h2>
        
        <p>Sometimes we need to use prepositions in relative clauses. There are two ways to do this:</p>

        <h3>1. Preposition at the end (informal, more common in speaking)</h3>
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The man <span class="grammar-highlight">who I was talking to</span> is my cousin.</li>
            <li>The chair <span class="grammar-highlight">which she was sitting on</span> broke.</li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">which I work for</span> is international.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Preposition before the relative pronoun (formal, more common in writing)</h3>
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>The man <span class="grammar-highlight">to whom</span> I was talking is my cousin.</li>
            <li>The chair <span class="grammar-highlight">on which</span> she was sitting broke.</li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">for which</span> I work is international.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> In casual conversation, native speakers almost always put the preposition at the end of the clause. The formal structure with preposition + whom/which sounds very formal and is mainly used in academic or legal writing.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Reduced Relative Clauses</h2>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: We can shorten (reduce) relative clauses in certain situations, especially in writing, to make our language more concise.</p>

        <h3>Active Reduced Relative Clauses</h3>
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Full relative clause:</strong> The man who is standing at the bus stop is my neighbor.<br>
          <strong>Reduced relative clause:</strong> The man standing at the bus stop is my neighbor.</p>

          <p><strong>Full relative clause:</strong> The children who are playing in the garden are very noisy.<br>
          <strong>Reduced relative clause:</strong> The children playing in the garden are very noisy.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Passive Reduced Relative Clauses</h3>
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>Full relative clause:</strong> The book which was written by Mark Twain is a classic.<br>
          <strong>Reduced relative clause:</strong> The book written by Mark Twain is a classic.</p>

          <p><strong>Full relative clause:</strong> The car that was damaged in the accident was repaired.<br>
          <strong>Reduced relative clause:</strong> The car damaged in the accident was repaired.</p>
