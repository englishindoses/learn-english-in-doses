# Advanced Reporting Verbs and Their Patterns

## Content for Grammar Page

---

## INTRODUCTION SECTION

**Introduction paragraph:**

When we report what people say, think, or do, we often use reporting verbs like "say" or "tell." However, English has many more specific reporting verbs that add extra meaning to what we report. These verbs show the speaker's attitude, intention, or the way something was communicated. Learning these patterns is essential for academic writing, professional communication, and understanding nuanced English in news and formal contexts.

**Learning objectives (after this lesson, you will be able to):**

1. Use advanced reporting verbs with the correct grammatical patterns (verb + to-infinitive, verb + object + to-infinitive, verb + verb-ing).
2. Choose appropriate reporting verbs based on the speaker's intention or attitude.
3. Transform direct speech into reported speech using a variety of sophisticated reporting verbs.

## GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1: Reporting Verbs + To-Infinitive

**Form:** subject + reporting verb + to-infinitive

**Common verbs that follow this pattern:**

- agree, decide, demand, offer, promise, refuse, threaten, claim, swear

**When to use it:**

- When reporting someone's intentions, decisions, or commitments.
- When the subject of the reporting verb is the same as the person doing the action.
- When you want to show determination, willingness, or refusal.

**Examples:**

1. She **agreed to help** with the project. *(She said yes when asked to help.)*
2. He **refused to answer** any questions. *(He said no when asked questions.)*
3. The company **promised to deliver** the goods by Friday. *(The company said they would definitely deliver by Friday.)*
4. My colleague **offered to cover** my shift. *(My colleague said he would work instead of me.)*
5. The witness **claimed to have seen** the suspect. *(The witness said he saw the suspect, but we're not sure if it's true.)*

**Complete example with context:**

After the meeting, the manager **agreed to review** the proposal, but she **refused to make** any promises about approval.

**Native speaker note:** The verb "claim" often suggests doubt. If you say "He claims to be an expert," you're implying you don't fully believe him.

## GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2: Reporting Verbs + Object + To-Infinitive

**Form:** subject + reporting verb + object + to-infinitive

**Common verbs that follow this pattern:**

- advise, allow, ask, beg, convince, encourage, forbid, force, invite, order, permit, persuade, remind, tell, urge, warn

**When to use it:**

- When reporting that someone influenced another person's action.
- When there are two different people involved: the speaker and the person being spoken to.
- When reporting instructions, requests, or commands given to someone.

**Examples:**

1. The doctor **advised me to rest** for a few days. *(The doctor told me that resting would be good for me.)*
2. My boss **encouraged me to apply** for the promotion. *(My boss said positive things to make me want to apply.)*
3. The police **ordered the crowd to move** back. *(The police gave a command to the crowd.)*
4. She **persuaded him to change** his mind. *(She talked to him until he agreed to think differently.)*
5. The sign **warned visitors not to feed** the animals. *(The sign told visitors this was dangerous or wrong.)*

**Complete example with context:**

The travel agent **advised us to book** early and **reminded us to check** our passport expiry dates before travelling.

**Native speaker note:** "Tell" and "ask" are the most common verbs in this pattern in everyday speech. The others are used for more specific meanings.

---

## GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3: Reporting Verbs + Verb-ing

**Form:** subject + reporting verb + verb-ing

**Common verbs that follow this pattern:**

- admit, deny, mention, recommend, regret, suggest

**When to use it:**

- When reporting actions or admissions without specifying who should do them.
- When the focus is on the action itself rather than the person doing it.
- Often used with verbs that express attitudes about past actions.

**Examples:**

1. She **admitted making** a mistake. *(She said yes, she made a mistake.)*
2. He **denied stealing** the money. *(He said he did not steal the money.)*
3. The guide **recommended visiting** the museum early. *(The guide said visiting early would be a good idea.)*
4. My friend **suggested trying** the new restaurant. *(My friend said the new restaurant might be good.)*
5. I **regret not listening** to your advice. *(I feel sorry that I didn't listen.)*

**Complete example with context:**

When asked about the project failure, the team leader **admitted underestimating** the timeline but **denied ignoring** the warning signs.

**Native speaker note:** "Suggest" can also be followed by a that-clause: "She suggested that we try the new restaurant." Both patterns are correct.

---

## GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 4: Reporting Verbs + Object + Preposition + Verb-ing

**Form:** subject + reporting verb + object + preposition + verb-ing

**Common verbs that follow this pattern:**

- accuse (someone of), blame (someone for), congratulate (someone on), thank (someone for), warn (someone about/against)

**When to use it:**

- When reporting criticism, praise, or warnings that involve a specific person and action.
- When expressing cause and effect in reported speech.
- In formal writing or professional contexts.

**Examples:**

1. The manager **accused him of lying** about his qualifications. *(The manager said he lied about his qualifications.)*
2. She **blamed me for losing** the client. *(She said it was my fault that we lost the client.)*
3. My colleagues **congratulated me on getting** the promotion. *(My colleagues said well done for getting the promotion.)*
4. He **thanked her for helping** with the presentation. *(He said thank you because she helped.)*
5. The financial advisor **warned us against investing** all our savings. *(The advisor said this would be a bad idea.)*

**Complete example with context:**

After the audit, the director **accused the accountant of falsifying** records and **blamed the supervisors for failing** to notice the errors.

## KEY DIFFERENCES AND CHOOSING BETWEEN PATTERNS

**How to choose the right pattern:**

| Verb | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| suggest | + verb-ing | She suggested leaving early. |
| suggest | + that clause | She suggested that we leave early. |
| advise | + object + to-infinitive | He advised me to wait. |
| advise | + verb-ing (general advice) | He advised waiting. |
| recommend | + verb-ing | I recommend booking in advance. |
| recommend | + that clause | I recommend that you book in advance. |

**Important distinctions:**

1. **Promise vs. threaten:** Both use + to-infinitive, but promise is positive and threaten is negative.
   - She **promised to help**. *(positive commitment)*
   - He **threatened to resign**. *(negative consequence)*

2. **Persuade vs. convince:** Both mean to change someone's mind, but persuade always needs an object.
   - She **persuaded him to stay**. ✓
   - She **convinced him to stay**. ✓

3. **Deny vs. refuse:** Deny is about facts (+ verb-ing). Refuse is about actions (+ to-infinitive).
   - He **denied taking** the money. *(He said he didn't take it.)*
   - He **refused to take** the money. *(He said no when offered.)*

## COMMON ERRORS SECTION

**Error 1: Using the wrong verb pattern**

- ❌ She suggested me to go home early.
- ✓ She suggested going home early.
- ✓ She suggested that I go home early.

*Explanation: "Suggest" cannot be followed by object + to-infinitive. Use verb-ing or a that-clause.*

**Error 2: Forgetting the object before the infinitive**

- ❌ He advised to check the contract carefully.
- ✓ He advised me to check the contract carefully.
- ✓ He advised checking the contract carefully. *(general advice)*

*Explanation: With "advise" + to-infinitive, you must include an object (the person being advised).*

**Error 3: Using the wrong preposition after certain verbs**

- ❌ She accused him for stealing.
- ✓ She accused him of stealing.

*Explanation: "Accuse" is always followed by "of," not "for." Similarly, "blame" uses "for" and "congratulate" uses "on."*

## TIPS SECTION

📝 **Tip 1:** Group reporting verbs by their patterns and learn them together. Make flashcards with the verb on one side and its pattern + an example sentence on the other.

📝 **Tip 2:** When you hear or read reported speech, notice which reporting verb is used and what pattern follows it. Keep a vocabulary notebook with new reporting verbs organised by pattern.

📝 **Tip 3:** Remember that many reporting verbs carry attitude or emotion. "Insist" is stronger than "suggest." "Warn" is more urgent than "advise." Choosing the right verb makes your English more precise and natural.
