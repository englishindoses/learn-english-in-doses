      <!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
      <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Causative structures in English express when someone causes something to happen, typically by arranging for another person to do it. Passive causatives specifically focus on the result rather than who performed the action. These structures are essential for talking about services, experiences, and situations where you arrange for things to be done but don't do them yourself.</p>
        
        <h3>After this lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use "have something done" and "get something done" structures correctly</li>
          <li>Understand the subtle differences between the various causative forms</li>
          <li>Apply these structures to talk about services, experiences, and arrangements</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Have Something Done</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + have + object + past participle (V3) + (by + agent)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use this structure when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Someone arranges for a service to be done</li>
          <li>The subject doesn't perform the action themselves</li>
          <li>Discussing professional or paid services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">had our house painted</span> last month. (We arranged for painters to do this)</li>
            <li>I'm <span class="grammar-highlight">having my car serviced</span> tomorrow. (I've scheduled this service)</li>
            <li>The company <span class="grammar-highlight">had its website redesigned</span> by a professional. (They hired someone)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> This structure is neutral in tone and commonly used for standard services or arrangements. The emphasis is on the arrangement and result rather than who performed the action.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Get Something Done</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + get + object + past participle (V3) + (by + agent)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use this structure when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Someone arranges for something with some effort or difficulty</li>
          <li>Emphasising the achievement of getting something accomplished</li>
          <li>In more informal or conversational contexts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>I finally <span class="grammar-highlight">got my visa approved</span> after months of paperwork. (Emphasises effort/achievement)</li>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">got her article published</span> in a major magazine. (Suggests accomplishment)</li>
            <li>We <span class="grammar-highlight">got our application processed</span> quickly because we knew someone in the office. (Implies advantage)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> "Get something done" often implies more effort, difficulty, or personal involvement than "have something done." It's also more informal and common in spoken English.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- GRAMMAR POINT SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Negative Experiences with Causatives</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: subject + have/get + object + past participle (V3)</p>
        
        <p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Use this structure when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Something negative happens to the subject's possessions or themselves</li>
          <li>The subject didn't want or arrange for it to happen</li>
          <li>Describing unfortunate events or victimisation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
          <ol>
            <li>She <span class="grammar-highlight">had her purse stolen</span> on the train. (She didn't arrange this; it happened to her)</li>
            <li>They <span class="grammar-highlight">got their window broken</span> during the storm. (Unwanted experience)</li>
            <li>He <span class="grammar-highlight">had his identity stolen</span> when he used that unsecured website. (Negative consequence)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Native speaker note:</strong> For negative experiences, the context makes it clear that the subject was a victim rather than someone who arranged for the action. The structure is the same as for arranged services, but the meaning is different.</p>

        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 1:</strong> To decide whether to use "have" or "get" in causative structures, consider the formality of the situation and whether you want to emphasise effort or achievement (use "get") or simply state a fact (use "have").</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 2:</strong> For negative experiences, the same structure is used, but the context makes it clear that you didn't arrange for it to happen. If in doubt, add information that clarifies it was unwanted: "I had my wallet stolen while I was on holiday."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grammar-tip">
          <p>üìù <strong>TIP 3:</strong> The causative structure is particularly useful when talking about services: haircuts, repairs, cleaning, etc. It's a very common way to describe such situations in English, so it's worth practising examples related to everyday services you might use.</p>
