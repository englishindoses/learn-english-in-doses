# Focusing Adverbs and Adverbials

Focusing adverbs are small but powerful words that draw the listener's or reader's attention to a specific part of a sentence. Words like *only*, *even*, *just*, *especially*, and *mainly* help you highlight exactly what you mean. These adverbs are extremely common in both spoken and written English, but their meaning changes depending on where you place them in a sentence. Learning to use them accurately will help you communicate more precisely.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**

- Use focusing adverbs to highlight specific parts of a sentence.
- Position focusing adverbs correctly to express your intended meaning.
- Choose between different focusing adverbs to add emphasis, limit meaning, or express surprise.

## Restrictive Focusing Adverbs: Only, Just, Merely

**Form:** focusing adverb + the word or phrase being focused on

**When to use it:**

Restrictive focusing adverbs limit the meaning of a sentence to one specific thing. They say "this and nothing else" or "this and no more." The most common ones are *only*, *just*, and *merely*. Place them directly before the word or phrase you want to focus on.

**Key rules:**

- **Only** — the most common restrictive focusing adverb. It limits the sentence to one particular element.
- **Just** — similar to *only*, but slightly more informal.
- **Merely** — similar to *only*, but more formal. It often downplays the importance of something.
- The **position** of the focusing adverb changes the meaning. Place it directly before the element you want to restrict.

1. She **only** eats vegetables on weekdays. (she does nothing else with vegetables — she eats them. She does not grow them or sell them.)
2. She eats **only** vegetables on weekdays. (she eats vegetables and nothing else — no meat, no fish.)
3. She eats vegetables **only** on weekdays. (she does this on weekdays and at no other time.)

**Native speaker note:** In casual speech, native speakers often place *only* and *just* in mid position regardless of what they are focusing on, and rely on spoken stress to make the meaning clear. In writing, position matters much more because the reader cannot hear your emphasis.

## Additive Focusing Adverbs: Also, Too, As Well, Even

**Form:** focusing adverb + the word or phrase being added

**When to use it:**

Additive focusing adverbs tell the reader that something is being added to what is already known or expected. They say "this too" or "in addition to what you already know."

**Key rules:**

- **Also** — goes in mid position (before the main verb or after the first auxiliary verb). Used in both formal and informal English.
- **Too** — goes at the end of a sentence or clause. Used in informal and neutral English.
- **As well** — goes at the end of a sentence. Similar to *too* and used in the same way.
- **Even** — adds something surprising or unexpected. It goes directly before the word or phrase it focuses on.

1. She speaks French and she **also** speaks Japanese. (Japanese is an additional language.)
2. He visited the museum and the art gallery **too**. (the gallery is added to the museum.)
3. **Even** the manager was surprised by the results. (it is surprising that the manager was surprised — you would not expect this.)

## Particularising Focusing Adverbs: Especially, Particularly, In Particular

**Form:** especially / particularly / in particular + the word, phrase, or clause being highlighted

**When to use it:**

These focusing adverbs single out one thing from a group and give it extra importance. They say "above all" or "more than the others."

**Key rules:**

- **Especially** — highlights one item as more important or relevant than others.
- **Particularly** — similar to *especially* and can be used interchangeably in most cases.
- **In particular** — used as a phrase, usually after a comma or at the end of a clause. Slightly more formal.
- These adverbs often appear after a general statement to narrow the focus.

1. The food was excellent, **especially** the seafood. (the seafood stood out from the rest.)
2. The course is useful for all employees, **particularly** those in management roles. (management employees benefit the most.)
3. Several cities in Italy are worth visiting. Florence, **in particular,** is beautiful in spring. (Florence is singled out from the group.)

## Focusing Adverbs for Emphasis: Mainly, Mostly, Largely, Primarily

**Form:** mainly / mostly / largely / primarily + the word, phrase, or clause being emphasised

**When to use it:**

These adverbs indicate that something is true for the most part, but not entirely. They say "to the greatest extent" or "for the majority."

**Key rules:**

- **Mainly** — used to say something is true for the biggest part.
- **Mostly** — very similar to *mainly*. Slightly more informal.
- **Largely** — more formal. Used to say something is true to a great extent.
- **Primarily** — the most formal of this group. Often used in academic and professional writing.
- These adverbs go in mid position (before the main verb) or at the start of a phrase they modify.

1. The team **mainly** works on international accounts. (this is what they do most of the time.)
2. The delay was **largely** due to problems with the supplier. (this was the biggest reason.)
3. The conference is **primarily** aimed at healthcare professionals. (they are the main target audience.)

## Key Differences

Focusing adverbs have different functions, and choosing the right one depends on what you want to communicate.

- **Restrictive** (*only, just, merely*) — limits the meaning: "this and nothing else."
- **Additive** (*also, too, even*) — adds information: "this as well" or "this is surprising."
- **Particularising** (*especially, particularly*) — singles out one from a group: "this one above all."
- **Emphasis** (*mainly, mostly, largely*) — describes the majority: "this for the most part."

Compare these sentences:

- I **only** invited colleagues. (nobody else — no friends, no family.)
- I **also** invited colleagues. (in addition to other people I already invited.)
- I invited colleagues, **especially** those from my department. (my department colleagues are highlighted.)
- I **mainly** invited colleagues. (most guests were colleagues, but perhaps a few others too.)

## Practice: Sentence Reordering

Put the words in the correct order to make grammatically correct sentences.

**1.** only / she / speaks / at / work / English
**Answer:** She only speaks English at work.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. *Only* is placed before the word it restricts — here, it restricts *English*.
**Incorrect feedback:** Where should *only* go to restrict the language, not the activity or the place?

**2.** even / the / surprised / was / director / by the news
**Answer:** Even the director was surprised by the news.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. *Even* goes before the word it focuses on — here, *the director* is the surprising element.
**Incorrect feedback:** *Even* should go directly before the surprising element. Who was unexpectedly surprised?

**3.** was / the food / excellent / especially / the dessert
**Answer:** The food was excellent, especially the dessert.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. *Especially* singles out *the dessert* from the food in general.
**Incorrect feedback:** *Especially* highlights one item from a group. It goes before the specific thing being singled out.

**4.** mainly / on / she / focuses / long-term / projects
**Answer:** She mainly focuses on long-term projects.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. *Mainly* goes in mid position before the main verb.
**Incorrect feedback:** Where do emphasis adverbs like *mainly* usually go? Think about mid position.

**5.** also / he / the / visited / castle / the / trip / during
**Answer:** He also visited the castle during the trip.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. *Also* goes in mid position before the main verb.
**Incorrect feedback:** *Also* is an additive adverb that goes in mid position. Where is that in this sentence?

**6.** conference / the / is / primarily / for / aimed / researchers / at
**Answer:** The conference is primarily aimed at researchers.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. *Primarily* goes before the main element being emphasised.
**Incorrect feedback:** *Primarily* is an emphasis adverb. It goes in mid position to indicate the main focus.

## Common Errors

**1: Placing *only* in the wrong position, changing the intended meaning.**

✗ She only told the manager about the problem. (intended meaning: she told the manager and nobody else.)

✓ She told only the manager about the problem.

*In writing, *only* must go directly before the word it restricts. Placing it before the verb can create ambiguity about what is being restricted.*

**2: Using *even* to mean "also" in a non-surprising context.**

✗ I visited the museum. I even visited the park. (a park visit is not surprising.)

✓ I visited the museum. I also visited the park.

*Even* implies surprise or something unexpected. If the addition is ordinary, use *also*, *too*, or *as well* instead.*

**3: Using *especially* at the start of a sentence as a conjunction.**

✗ Especially it was raining, we stayed inside.

✓ We stayed inside, especially because it was raining.

*Especially* is not a conjunction and cannot start an independent clause. It modifies a specific word or phrase, not a whole sentence.*

## Useful Tips

📌 **TIP 1:** To check if you have placed *only* or *just* correctly, ask yourself: "What exactly am I restricting?" Then place the adverb directly before that word. Read the sentence aloud to check if the meaning is what you intended. If you can move *only* to a different position and the sentence means the same thing, it might be in the wrong place.

📌 **TIP 2:** Remember that *even* always signals surprise. Before using it, ask: "Would this be unexpected?" If the answer is no, choose *also* or *too* instead. A good test is to imagine someone raising their eyebrows — if they would not, *even* is probably not the right word.

📌 **TIP 3:** When writing formal reports or essays, use *particularly*, *in particular*, or *primarily* instead of *especially* and *mainly*. They carry the same meaning but sound more professional. This small change can make a noticeable difference in the tone of your writing.
