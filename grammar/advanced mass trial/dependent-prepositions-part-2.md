# Dependent Prepositions — Part 2

In Part 1, you learned that many verbs are followed by fixed prepositions. The same is true for adjectives and nouns. Certain adjectives and nouns always require a specific preposition after them, and using the wrong one is a common mistake — even for advanced learners. Just like with verbs, there is no general rule for these combinations. They must be learned as fixed pairs. This page covers the most important adjective + preposition and noun + preposition combinations.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**

- Use the correct dependent preposition after common adjectives.
- Use the correct dependent preposition after common nouns.
- Form correct sentences using adjective/noun + preposition combinations followed by nouns and verb-ing forms.

## Adjectives Followed by "of"

**Form:** be + adjective + of + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Many adjectives that describe feelings, awareness, or qualities are followed by *of*.

**Key rules:**

- **Afraid of** — feeling fear about something.
- **Aware of** — knowing about something.
- **Capable of** — having the ability to do something.
- **Fond of** — liking something (often used for habits or people).
- **Proud of** — feeling satisfaction about an achievement.
- **Tired of** — feeling bored or frustrated with something that has continued too long.

3. They are **tired of** waiting for the repairs to be completed. (they are frustrated by the long wait.)

## Adjectives Followed by "about"

**Form:** be + adjective + about + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Adjectives followed by *about* usually express emotions or feelings towards a specific topic or situation.

**Key rules:**

- **Worried about** — feeling anxious about something.
- **Excited about** — feeling enthusiasm about something.
- **Serious about** — being genuine or committed to something.
- **Happy about** — feeling pleased about something.
- **Confused about** — not understanding something.

## Adjectives Followed by "for"

**Form:** be + adjective + for + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Adjectives followed by *for* often describe suitability, responsibility, readiness, or feelings towards someone.

**Key rules:**

## Adjectives Followed by "to"

**Form:** be + adjective + to + noun / noun phrase

**When to use it:**

Some adjectives are followed by the preposition *to* when describing a relationship or comparison between two things.

**Key rules:**

- **Similar to** — having things in common with something else.
- **Different from/to** — not the same as something else. (Both *from* and *to* are correct in British English.)
- **Accustomed to** — being used to something.
- **Married to** — being someone's husband or wife.
- **Addicted to** — being unable to stop doing or using something.
- **Committed to** — being dedicated to something.

1. This system is quite **similar to** the one we used at the previous company. (they have features in common.)
2. She is fully **committed to** improving working conditions for her team. (she is dedicated to it.)
3. He is **accustomed to** travelling long distances for work. (he is used to it.)

**Native speaker note:** In British English, both *different from* and *different to* are widely accepted. In American English, *different from* is strongly preferred. In formal writing, *different from* is the safest choice.

## Common Errors

**1: Using "interested for" or "interested about" instead of "interested in."**

✗ She is interested for learning more about the role.

✓ She is interested in learning more about the role.

*The adjective *interested* is always followed by *in*. This is one of the most common preposition errors learners make.*

**2: Confusing "responsible of" with "responsible for."**

✗ He is responsible of the marketing budget.

✓ He is responsible for the marketing budget.

*Responsible* is always followed by *for*, never *of*. Many learners make this mistake because their first language uses the equivalent of "of."*

**3: Using a wrong preposition after a noun.**

✗ The increase of prices affected everyone.

✓ The increase in prices affected everyone.

*The noun *increase* is followed by *in*, not *of*. Similarly, *decrease* and *rise* are also followed by *in*.*

## Useful Tips

📌 **TIP 1:** Learn adjective + preposition and noun + preposition combinations in exactly the same way as verb + preposition pairs: as fixed chunks. Write them on flashcards with example sentences so you remember the full combination, not just the individual words.

📌 **TIP 2:** When you are unsure which preposition follows an adjective or noun, try searching for the phrase in an online dictionary or corpus. Dictionaries almost always show the correct dependent preposition in their example sentences. Over time, you will build confidence with the most common combinations.

📌 **TIP 3:** Group similar adjectives by their preposition. For example, many emotion adjectives use *about* (worried about, excited about, happy about), while many ability or awareness adjectives use *of* (capable of, aware of, proud of). These groupings can help you guess the correct preposition even for combinations you have not memorised.
