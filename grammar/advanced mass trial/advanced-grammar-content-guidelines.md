# Advanced Grammar Page: Content Guidelines

These guidelines describe the content, structure, writing style, and standards for every advanced grammar explanation page on the English in Doses website. Follow them closely to ensure consistency across all pages.

---

## Page Title

- The page title (h1) should be the grammar topic name.
- It should be clear and specific. For example: "That-Clauses and If/Whether Clauses" or "Passive Reporting Verbs."
- If the grammar topic is commonly known by a simpler name, use that. Avoid overly academic titles that might confuse learners.

---

## Content Length: When to Split a Topic

- A single grammar page should not try to cover too much. If there is too much content for one page, the topic must be split across 2 or more pages.
- As a general rule, if a topic requires more than 5 grammar point sections, it should be split.
- When splitting, each page should be self-contained with its own introduction, learning objectives, grammar sections, common errors, tips, sentence ordering activity, summary table, and MCQ quiz.
- Give each page a clear title that shows it is part of a series (e.g. "Nominal Clauses," "Nominal Clauses — Part 2," "Nominal Clauses — Review!").
- A review page can be added after a multi-page topic to bring everything together.

---

## Section 1: Introduction

The introduction is the first thing the learner sees. It must do two things: explain what the grammar is and list the learning objectives.

### Introduction paragraph

- Write one or two short paragraphs.
- Explain what the grammar structure is in simple, plain language.
- Tell the learner why this grammar is useful and where they will encounter it (e.g. formal writing, academic texts, everyday conversation, news reports).
- Do not use the grammar structure itself in the introduction unless it is very simple. The learner has not learned it yet at this point.
- Keep sentences short and avoid complex vocabulary.

**Example:**
> Inverted conditionals are an advanced grammar structure used in formal English and literature. Instead of using "if" at the beginning of a conditional sentence, the subject and auxiliary verb are inverted (switched around). This creates a more formal and sometimes more dramatic way to express hypothetical situations.

### Learning objectives

- Listed under the heading: **"After this lesson, you will be able to:"**
- Exactly **3 learning objectives**. No more, no fewer.
- Each objective must be measurable and action-oriented (use verbs like "use," "form," "choose," "identify differences between").
- Objectives should cover the main skills the learner will gain from the page.
- Each objective ends with a full stop.

**Example:**
> - Use that-clauses to express facts, opinions, and reported speech in subject and object positions.
> - Form if/whether clauses to express uncertainty and indirect yes/no questions in different positions.
> - Use complement clauses after linking verbs to explain and describe subjects.

---

## Section 2: Grammar Point Sections

This is the main teaching content of the page. There will be **one or more grammar point sections**, depending on how many distinct structures or uses the topic covers. Each grammar point section follows the same internal structure described below.

### How many grammar point sections?

- Use one section per distinct grammar structure or use.
- A simple topic (e.g. one structure with a few uses) may need only 1–2 sections.
- A complex topic comparing multiple structures may need 3–5 sections.
- Each section should focus on one clear idea. Do not overload a single section with too many different rules.

### Internal structure of each grammar point section

Each grammar point section should contain the following elements in this order:

#### a) Section title (h2)

- A clear, descriptive name for the grammar point or sub-topic.
- Examples: "That-Clauses," "Wh-Clauses," "Modal + Have + Past Participle (V3)."

#### b) Form

- Labelled with **"Form:"** in bold.
- Show the grammatical formula/structure clearly.
- Use lowercase for the formula (no capital letters).
- Use colour highlighting only if it genuinely makes the structure easier to understand.
- When the past participle is mentioned, always include **(V3)** in brackets.
- When the -ing form of a verb is needed, write it as **verb-ing**.

**Example:**
> **Form:** modal + have + past participle (V3)
>
> **Form:** had been + verb-ing

#### c) When to use it

- Labelled with **"When to use it:"** in bold.
- A clear, simple explanation of the meaning and when this form is appropriate.
- If there are distinct sub-uses (e.g. subject clauses vs. object clauses), list them with brief labels using **"Key rules:"** as a sub-heading.

#### d) Examples

- **Exactly 3 examples each time examples are shown.** No more, no fewer. This means 3 examples per group of examples, not per grammar point section. If a grammar point section has sub-uses (e.g. "passive meaning" and "describing a state"), each sub-use gets its own group of exactly 3 examples.
- Present examples in a numbered list.
- Every example sentence must include a **short clarification in brackets** explaining its meaning. This helps the learner understand the context without needing to guess.
- The target grammar structure within the example should be visually highlighted (e.g. bold or a highlight span) so the learner can see it clearly.
- Example sentences should be **short and simple**. The grammar being taught should be the only difficult language. Do not use complex vocabulary or complicated sentence structures alongside the target grammar.
- Examples should draw from **three contexts: work, daily life, and travel**. There is no need to label which context each example comes from — simply vary them naturally.
- Examples must sound natural. They should be sentences a real person might say or write.

**Example:**
> 1. **What he said** surprised everyone. (his words were surprising)
> 2. **Where she works** is confidential. (her workplace is secret)
> 3. **How they solved the problem** impressed the manager. (their solution was impressive)

#### e) Native speaker note (optional)

- Include this **only** if it provides a genuinely useful insight into how native speakers actually use the grammar in real life.
- Do not include a native speaker note just for the sake of having one. If there is nothing useful to say, leave it out.
- The note should be practical and relevant, such as: how the grammar sounds in casual speech, how native speakers might shorten or simplify the form, common informal alternatives, or subtle connotations the learner should be aware of.
- Keep it to 1–3 sentences.
- Label it: **"Native speaker note:"** in bold.

**Example:**
> **Native speaker note:** In casual conversation, native speakers often contract "could have" to "could've" which sounds like "could of." Always write "could have" — never "could of."

---

## Section 3: Key Differences / Choosing Between Forms (Optional)

This section is optional. It can be included when the page teaches two or more structures that could be confused with each other **and** when a dedicated comparison section adds value without making the page too long, repetitive, or boring. If each grammar point section already explains its own comparisons clearly enough, this section is not needed. Use your judgement — if the page already feels content-heavy, leave it out.

### Content

- A clear explanation of how to choose between the forms.
- A bullet list summarising the key difference for each form (what it emphasises or when to use it).
- **Comparative examples** showing the same or similar situation expressed with different forms. This helps the learner see the difference in meaning or emphasis.
- Comparative examples should be grouped together (2–3 forms shown side by side for the same scenario), with a brief explanation after each one.

**Example:**
> - **Must have:** Strong logical conclusion about the past (high certainty).
> - **Could have:** Unrealised possibility or ability in the past.
> - **Should have:** Unfulfilled obligation or better alternative in the past.

---

## Section 4: Sentence Ordering Activity

This is a drag-and-drop style activity where learners put words into the correct order to form grammatically correct sentences. It comes after the teaching content and before the summary table.

### Section heading

- Heading: **"Practice: Sentence Reordering"**
- A short introductory sentence telling the learner what to do. For example: "Drag the words into the correct order to make sentences with causative verbs."

### Number of questions

- **5 to 8 sentence ordering questions.**

### Question content

- Each question presents a set of jumbled words that the learner must arrange into a correct sentence.
- The sentences must use the grammar taught on the page.
- Like the MCQ questions, these should cover the different grammar points from the page — not just one sub-topic.
- Sentences should be short and use simple vocabulary. The grammar being practised is the only challenge.
- Questions should progress from easier to harder.

### Feedback

- Each question should have feedback for correct and incorrect answers.

---

## Section 5: Summary Table

Every page must include a summary table. This gives the learner a quick visual reference they can return to when revising.

### Content

- The table should summarise the main grammar points covered on the page.
- Use clear column headings. Common columns include: Feature, Form, Focus, Common time markers, Best for expressing, When to use, Example, Use, Formality.
- Choose columns that are most relevant to the specific grammar topic. Not every table needs the same columns.
- Keep cell content brief — short phrases, not full paragraphs.
- If the page compares two structures, the table should have one column per structure.
- If the page covers multiple types of a structure (e.g. several passive forms), each type gets its own row.
- The summary table should have an **id of "summary"** so the MCQ section can link back to it for review.

---

## Section 6: Common Errors

This section highlights mistakes that ESL learners actually make with this grammar point.

### Content

- **Maximum 3 common errors.** Choose the 3 most frequent and important mistakes.
- Each error follows this format:
  1. **Error title** — a short, descriptive name (e.g. "Using 'of' instead of 'have'").
  2. **Incorrect sentence** — clearly marked as wrong. Use a cross symbol (✗) or red styling.
  3. **Correct sentence** — clearly marked as correct. Use a tick symbol (✓) or green styling.
  4. **Explanation** — a brief explanation (1–2 sentences) of why the error occurs and how to avoid it. Written in italics.
- Errors should be **real mistakes that ESL students actually make**. Do not invent unlikely errors.
- The incorrect sentences must be genuinely wrong. The correct sentences must be genuinely correct.
- Keep error examples short and focused on one mistake per error.

**Example:**
> **1: Using "of" instead of "have"**
>
> ✗ She could of told me earlier.
>
> ✓ She could have told me earlier.
>
> *This error occurs because "could've" (contraction of "could have") sounds like "could of" when spoken. Always use "have" in written English, not "of."*

---

## Section 7: Tips

This section gives the learner practical advice on how to remember and practise the grammar.

### Content

- **Maximum 3 tips.** Each tip should be genuinely useful and actionable.
- Tips must **not repeat information already given in the grammar explanation**. They should add new value.
- Each tip is labelled: **📌 TIP 1:**, **📌 TIP 2:**, **📌 TIP 3:**.
- Tips can include: memory tricks, study strategies, practice suggestions, ways to notice the grammar in real life, or advice about when to use (or avoid) the grammar.
- Each tip should be 2–4 sentences long.
- The section heading is: **"Useful Tips"** (or "How to Remember and Practice" — either is acceptable, but be consistent across pages).

**Example:**
> 📌 **TIP 1:** Think of conditionals on a probability scale: Zero (100% — facts), First (likely future), Second (unlikely present/future), Third (impossible past). This helps you choose the right form based on how probable the situation is.

---

## Section 8: MCQ Practice (Test Your Knowledge)

Every page ends with a multiple-choice quiz so learners can test their understanding immediately.

### Section heading and introduction

- Heading: **"Test Your Knowledge"** (or occasionally "Quick Practice").
- A short introductory sentence telling the learner what the quiz covers. For example: "Choose the correct option for each question to test your understanding of passive reporting verbs."

### Number of questions

- **Exactly 10 MCQ questions per page.**

### Answer options

- **3 answer options per question** (labelled A, B, C).

### Question difficulty progression

- Questions should progress from **easier to harder** across the 10 questions.
- Early questions (1–3) should test basic understanding of the form.
- Middle questions (4–7) should test usage in context.
- Later questions (8–10) should test more nuanced understanding, such as choosing between similar forms, identifying errors, or applying the grammar in more complex scenarios.

### Question content rules (from MCQ rules)

**MCQ questions should:**
- Test the learner's ability to **use** the grammar correctly.
- Test the learner's ability to **choose appropriate scenarios** to use the grammar.
- Only test grammar that has been **specifically covered** on the explanation page.
- **Cover all grammar points** mentioned on the explanation page (not just one sub-topic).

**MCQ questions should NOT:**
- Test the learner's ability to **recognise** the grammar (e.g. "Which sentence contains a passive?" — avoid this type unless it genuinely tests understanding).
- Be overly complicated.
- Use difficult vocabulary not suitable for the learner's level.
- Include grammar points or rules that have **not been covered** on the page.

### Question style

- Questions use **gap-fill format** (sentence with a blank: "_____") as the primary format.
- Some questions may use a **scenario format** (e.g. "A newspaper needs to report unverified information. Which sentence is most appropriate?").
- Some questions may ask the learner to **identify an error** (e.g. "Which of these is grammatically INCORRECT?").
- Mix these formats across the 10 questions for variety, but gap-fill should be the most common format.

### Feedback

- Each question must have **feedback for both correct and incorrect answers**.
- Correct feedback explains **why the answer is right**, reinforcing the grammar rule.
- Incorrect feedback gives a **helpful hint** pointing the learner toward the right answer without giving it away directly.

### Post-quiz elements

- A **score display** showing the result out of 10 (e.g. "Your score: 7/10").
- A **"Check Answers"** button to submit.
- A **"Review Grammar"** link that takes the learner back to the summary table.
- A **"Try Again"** button to restart the quiz.

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

These rules apply to all written content across every section of the page.

### Language level

- Use **simple, clear English** that advanced ESL learners can understand.
- Avoid unnecessarily complex vocabulary. If a simpler word works, use it.
- The **only** new or difficult language on the page should be the grammar being taught.
- Example sentences must use simple grammar and vocabulary. Do not combine the target grammar with other difficult structures.

### Sentence length

- Keep sentences short. Aim for 10–20 words per sentence as a general guide.
- Break long explanations into multiple short sentences rather than one complex sentence.

### Spelling and language variety

- Use **British English spelling** (e.g. "recognise," "emphasise," "colour," "behaviour").
- Use **neutral, international language**. Avoid slang, idioms, or culturally specific references that some learners may not understand.

### Punctuation — hard rule, no exceptions

- **Every single sentence must end with the correct punctuation mark** (full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark).
- This applies everywhere, without exception: bullet points, numbered lists, table cells, brackets, parenthetical notes, example sentences, clarifications in brackets, error explanations, tips, learning objectives, and any other text on the page.
- If it is a sentence, it ends with a punctuation mark. There are no exceptions to this rule.

### Terminology conventions

- When mentioning the **past participle**, always include **(V3)** in brackets afterwards.
- When the **-ing form** of a verb is needed, write it as **verb-ing** (e.g. "had been + verb-ing").
- When showing grammatical form/structure, use **lowercase letters** (no capitals).

### Tone

- Supportive and encouraging, but not patronising.
- Direct and clear. Get to the point without unnecessary padding.
- Professional but approachable — like a knowledgeable teacher explaining something to a motivated student.

### Examples

- Always draw from **work, daily life, and travel** contexts. No need to label the context.
- Every example must include a **short clarification in brackets**.
- Examples must sound **natural** — like something a real person would say or write.
- Exactly **3 examples each time examples are shown**. If a grammar point has sub-uses, each sub-use gets exactly 3 examples.

---

## Content Amount Guide

To help gauge the appropriate length for a page:

| Section | Approximate length |
|---|---|
| Introduction paragraph | 2–4 sentences. |
| Learning objectives | Exactly 3 bullet points. |
| Each grammar point section | 1 paragraph of explanation + key rules (if needed) + exactly 3 examples per group (a section may have multiple groups if it covers sub-uses) + optional native speaker note. |
| Key differences section (optional) | 1 paragraph + bullet list + 2–3 sets of comparative examples. |
| Sentence ordering activity | 5–8 sentence reordering questions. |
| Summary table | One table with 4–8 rows depending on topic complexity. |
| Common errors | Exactly 3 errors (title + incorrect + correct + explanation each). |
| Tips | Exactly 3 tips (2–4 sentences each). |
| MCQ section | Exactly 10 questions with 3 options each. |

A typical grammar page will have **2–5 grammar point sections** depending on the complexity of the topic. Simpler topics sit at the lower end; topics that compare multiple forms or have several distinct uses sit at the higher end.
