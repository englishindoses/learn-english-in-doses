# Multiple Adverbs

When a sentence contains more than one adverb, the order in which they appear matters. Putting adverbs in the wrong order can make a sentence sound awkward or unnatural. English follows a general pattern for ordering multiple adverbs, especially when they appear at the end of a sentence. This page builds on the Adverb Position page and focuses on how to arrange two or more adverbs correctly.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**

- Arrange multiple adverbs in the correct order at the end of a sentence.
- Apply the manner–place–time pattern to sentences with two or more adverbs.
- Adjust adverb order for emphasis and natural style.

## The Manner–Place–Time Rule

**Form:** subject + verb + (object) + manner adverb + place adverb + time adverb

**When to use it:**

When two or more adverbs appear at the end of a sentence, they generally follow this order: **manner** (how), then **place** (where), then **time** (when). This is sometimes called the **MPT rule**. Not every sentence will have all three types, but when more than one is present, this order sounds the most natural.

1. She worked **quietly** **in the library** **all afternoon**. (manner + place + time.)
2. He drove **carefully** **through the city centre** **this morning**. (manner + place + time.)
3. They walked **slowly** **along the beach** **after dinner**. (manner + place + time.)

**Native speaker note:** Native speakers follow this order instinctively. If you ever feel uncertain, try saying the sentence aloud with manner first, then place, then time — it will almost always sound right.

## Two Adverbs: Common Combinations

**When to use it:**

Most sentences with multiple adverbs use just two, not three. The most common combinations are manner + place, manner + time, and place + time. The same order rule applies — follow MPT and simply skip the missing type.

**Manner + place:**

1. She spoke **confidently** **at the meeting**. (how + where.)
2. He waited **patiently** **at the airport**. (how + where.)
3. They practised **hard** **in the training room**. (how + where.)

**Place + time:**

1. We arrived **at the hotel** **late last night**. (where + when.)
2. She works **from home** **every Friday**. (where + when.)
3. He stayed **in the office** **until 8 p.m.** (where + when.)

**Manner + time:**

1. She finished the task **efficiently** **before the deadline**. (how + when.)
2. He responded **politely** **straight away**. (how + when.)
3. They prepared **carefully** **the night before**. (how + when.)

## Adverbs of Frequency with Other Adverbs

**Form:** subject + frequency adverb (mid position) + verb + (object) + other adverbs (end position)

**When to use it:**

Frequency adverbs (how often) stay in their usual mid position — before the main verb. Other adverbs (manner, place, time) go in end position as normal. This means frequency adverbs do not compete for end position with manner, place, or time adverbs.

1. She **always** works **efficiently** **at the office**. (frequency in mid + manner and place at end.)
2. He **usually** arrives **at the station** **early**. (frequency in mid + place and time at end.)
3. They **often** meet **in the café** **after work**. (frequency in mid + place and time at end.)

## Changing Adverb Order for Emphasis

**When to use it:**

The MPT rule is the standard order, but English allows some flexibility when you want to emphasise a particular adverb. You can move an adverb to front position to give it extra emphasis. The adverb you move to the front becomes the focus of the sentence.

**Key rules:**

- Moving a **time adverb** to the front is very common and always sounds natural. It sets the scene for what follows.
- Moving a **place adverb** to the front is also possible, especially in storytelling and descriptions.
- Moving a **manner adverb** to the front is less common and can sound formal or dramatic. Use this sparingly.

1. **Every morning,** she exercises **at the gym**. (time moved to front for emphasis.)
2. **In the conference room,** they discussed the plan **quietly**. (place moved to front to set the scene.)
3. **Carefully,** he opened the old suitcase. (manner moved to front for dramatic effect.)

## Key Differences

When deciding where to place multiple adverbs, the main question is which type each adverb belongs to.

- **Manner** answers "how?" and goes first at the end.
- **Place** answers "where?" and goes second.
- **Time** answers "when?" and goes last.
- **Frequency** answers "how often?" and stays in mid position.

Compare these sentences:

- She studied **hard** **in the library** **yesterday**. (MPT order — sounds natural.)
- She studied **yesterday** **hard** **in the library**. (wrong order — sounds awkward and unnatural.)
- She **always** studies **hard** **in the library**. (frequency in mid position + manner and place at end — correct.)

## Practice: Sentence Reordering

Put the words in the correct order to make grammatically correct sentences.

**1.** spoke / she / clearly / at the presentation / yesterday
**Answer:** She spoke clearly at the presentation yesterday.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. The adverbs follow MPT order: manner (*clearly*), place (*at the presentation*), time (*yesterday*).
**Incorrect feedback:** Remember the manner–place–time rule. Which adverb tells you how, which tells you where, and which tells you when?

**2.** usually / he / early / arrives / at work
**Answer:** He usually arrives at work early.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. The frequency adverb *usually* stays in mid position, and the other adverbs go at the end.
**Incorrect feedback:** Frequency adverbs go in mid position. The remaining adverbs follow the place–time pattern at the end.

**3.** carefully / they / packed / their suitcases / last night
**Answer:** They packed their suitcases carefully last night.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. Manner (*carefully*) comes before time (*last night*) at the end.
**Incorrect feedback:** Where do manner adverbs go in relation to time adverbs at the end of a sentence?

**4.** practised / in the studio / every evening / she / hard
**Answer:** She practised hard in the studio every evening.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. The order is manner (*hard*), place (*in the studio*), time (*every evening*).
**Incorrect feedback:** Apply the MPT rule: manner first, then place, then time.

**5.** waits / always / patiently / at the bus stop / he
**Answer:** He always waits patiently at the bus stop.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. Frequency (*always*) is in mid position, and manner (*patiently*) and place (*at the bus stop*) are at the end.
**Incorrect feedback:** Put the frequency adverb in mid position first, then arrange the remaining adverbs using the manner–place pattern.

**6.** every morning / walks / she / slowly / through the park
**Answer:** Every morning, she walks slowly through the park.
**Also accepted:** She walks slowly through the park every morning.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. Time can go at the front for emphasis, with manner and place at the end.
**Incorrect feedback:** Time adverbs can go at the front or end. The manner adverb should come before the place adverb.

## Common Errors

**1: Putting time before manner at the end of a sentence.**

✗ She finished yesterday quickly the report.

✓ She finished the report quickly yesterday.

*When two or more adverbs appear at the end of a sentence, follow the manner–place–time rule. Manner (how) comes before time (when).*

**2: Putting a frequency adverb at the end with other adverbs.**

✗ He arrives at the office early always.

✓ He always arrives at the office early.

*Frequency adverbs (always, usually, often) stay in mid position. They do not move to end position, even when other adverbs are there.*

**3: Placing a manner adverb between the verb and its object.**

✗ She read carefully the instructions at home.

✓ She read the instructions carefully at home.

*Manner adverbs go after the object, not between the verb and the object. Then place and time adverbs follow.*

## Useful Tips

📌 **TIP 1:** Think of the end of a sentence as having invisible slots: HOW → WHERE → WHEN. When you write a sentence with multiple adverbs, mentally fill in these slots in order. You do not need all three every time — just keep the ones you use in this order.

📌 **TIP 2:** If a sentence with multiple adverbs at the end feels too long or heavy, move the time adverb to front position. This is a natural and common technique in English writing. For example, "Yesterday, she worked hard at the office" feels lighter than putting everything at the end.

📌 **TIP 3:** Read English news articles and highlight sentences with two or more adverbs. Notice the order the writer uses. You will see the MPT pattern appearing again and again, which will help you internalise the rule without memorising it.
