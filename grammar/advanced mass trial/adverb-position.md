# Adverb Position

Adverbs add important information to sentences, such as how, when, where, or how often something happens. However, the position of an adverb in a sentence can change the meaning or make the sentence sound unnatural. In English, adverbs can go in three main positions: front, mid, or end. Knowing where to place an adverb correctly is essential for clear and natural-sounding English.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**

- Identify and use the three main adverb positions in English sentences.
- Choose the correct position for different types of adverbs.
- Use front-position adverbs to connect ideas and set the scene in writing and speech.

## Front Position

**Form:** adverb + comma + subject + verb

**When to use it:**

Front position means placing the adverb at the beginning of the sentence, usually followed by a comma. This position is common for certain types of adverbs.

**Key rules:**

- **Connecting adverbs** (linking ideas between sentences) usually go in front position. These include words like *however*, *therefore*, *furthermore*, *nevertheless*, and *meanwhile*.
- **Time adverbs** often go in front position to set the scene. These include words like *yesterday*, *last week*, *in the morning*, and *recently*.
- **Comment adverbs** (giving the speaker's opinion) can also go in front position. These include words like *unfortunately*, *surprisingly*, and *clearly*. (These are covered in detail on the Comment Adverbs page.)

1. **Unfortunately,** the flight was delayed by three hours. (the speaker feels this is bad news.)
2. **Yesterday,** we had an important meeting with the new client. (sets the time for the event.)
3. **However,** the hotel was much better than we expected. (contrasts with a previous idea.)

**Native speaker note:** In formal writing, front-position connecting adverbs (like *however* and *therefore*) are very common. In casual speech, people often use simpler words like *but* and *so* instead.

## Mid Position

**Form:** subject + (auxiliary verb) + adverb + main verb

**When to use it:**

Mid position means placing the adverb between the subject and the main verb, or after the first auxiliary verb. This is the most common position for several important types of adverbs.

**Key rules:**

- **Frequency adverbs** (how often) almost always go in mid position. These include *always*, *usually*, *often*, *sometimes*, *rarely*, *never*, and *seldom*.
- **Certainty adverbs** (how sure) often go in mid position. These include *probably*, *certainly*, *definitely*, and *clearly*.
- **Degree adverbs** that modify verbs often go in mid position. These include *almost*, *nearly*, *hardly*, *completely*, and *just*.
- With the verb **be** (used alone, not as an auxiliary), the adverb goes **after** *be*, not before it.
- With **auxiliary verbs**, the adverb goes **after the first auxiliary**.

1. She **always** arrives at the office before 9 a.m. (frequency — every day without exception.)
2. They have **probably** forgotten about the reservation. (certainty — it is likely.)
3. I **nearly** missed the train to the airport. (degree — it almost happened.)

**Native speaker note:** With the verb *be* used alone, the adverb comes after it: "She **is always** on time," not "She always is on time." This is a common mistake to watch out for.

## End Position

**Form:** subject + verb + (object) + adverb

**When to use it:**

End position means placing the adverb at the end of the sentence or clause, after the verb and its object (if there is one). This is the most common position for manner adverbs and place adverbs.

**Key rules:**

- **Manner adverbs** (how something is done) usually go in end position. These include *quickly*, *carefully*, *well*, *badly*, and *loudly*.
- **Place adverbs** (where) go in end position. These include *here*, *there*, *everywhere*, *abroad*, and *outside*.
- **Time adverbs** can also go in end position. This is more common in informal speech and everyday conversation.
- If there is an **object**, the adverb goes **after the object**, not between the verb and the object.

1. She completed the report **quickly**. (manner — describes how she completed it.)
2. We looked for a pharmacy **everywhere**. (place — describes where we looked.)
3. He called the hotel **yesterday**. (time — describes when he called.)

**Native speaker note:** Placing a manner adverb between the verb and object sounds unnatural in most cases. Say "She speaks English **well**," not "She speaks well English."

## Adverbs with Fixed or Restricted Positions

**When to use it:**

Some adverbs have fixed or restricted positions. They sound wrong or change meaning if placed in a different position.

**Key rules:**

- **Still** goes in mid position (before the main verb or after *be*). It does not normally go at the end.
- **Yet** goes at the end of negative sentences and questions.
- **Already** goes in mid position in British English. It can also go at the end for emphasis.
- **Enough** goes **after** the adjective or adverb it modifies, not before it.
- **Also** goes in mid position. Avoid placing it at the start of a sentence in formal writing.

1. She **still** hasn't replied to my email. (*still* goes before the main verb.)
2. Have you booked the flights **yet**? (*yet* goes at the end of a question.)
3. He has **already** finished the presentation. (*already* in mid position in British English.)

## Key Differences

Choosing the correct adverb position depends on the type of adverb. Here is a quick summary:

- **Front position** is for connecting adverbs and time-setting adverbs.
- **Mid position** is for frequency, certainty, and degree adverbs.
- **End position** is for manner and place adverbs.

Compare these examples:

- **Unfortunately,** he lost his passport. (front — comment adverb giving the speaker's attitude.)
- He **probably** lost his passport. (mid — certainty adverb showing likelihood.)
- He lost his passport **yesterday**. (end — time adverb in casual speech.)

## Practice: Sentence Reordering

Put the words in the correct order to make grammatically correct sentences.

**1.** always / she / arrives / early / at work
**Answer:** She always arrives early at work.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. Frequency adverbs like *always* go in mid position, before the main verb.
**Incorrect feedback:** Think about where frequency adverbs go. Do they come before or after the main verb?

**2.** unfortunately / cancelled / the / was / meeting
**Answer:** Unfortunately, the meeting was cancelled.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. Comment adverbs like *unfortunately* often go in front position.
**Incorrect feedback:** Where do comment adverbs usually go when they apply to the whole sentence?

**3.** speaks / he / fluently / Spanish
**Answer:** He speaks Spanish fluently.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. Manner adverbs go in end position, after the object.
**Incorrect feedback:** Remember, manner adverbs go after the verb and its object, not between them.

**4.** have / they / not / replied / yet
**Answer:** They have not replied yet.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. *Yet* goes at the end of negative sentences.
**Incorrect feedback:** Think about where *yet* goes in negative sentences. Does it go in the middle or at the end?

**5.** probably / will / she / the / get / job
**Answer:** She will probably get the job.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. Certainty adverbs like *probably* go after the first auxiliary verb.
**Incorrect feedback:** Where do certainty adverbs go when there is an auxiliary verb?

**6.** yesterday / finished / I / the / report
**Answer:** Yesterday, I finished the report.
**Also accepted:** I finished the report yesterday.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. Time adverbs can go in front or end position.
**Incorrect feedback:** Time adverbs can go at the start or end of the sentence. Try one of those positions.

**7.** still / waiting / is / for / he / the / bus
**Answer:** He is still waiting for the bus.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. *Still* goes after the verb *be* or before the main verb.
**Incorrect feedback:** Remember, *still* has a fixed mid position. It goes after *be* or before the main verb.

## Common Errors

**1: Placing a manner adverb between the verb and object.**

✗ She speaks fluently English.

✓ She speaks English fluently.

*Manner adverbs go after the object, not between the verb and the object. This is one of the most common word-order mistakes for English learners.*

**2: Putting a frequency adverb after the main verb instead of before it.**

✗ She goes always to the gym on Mondays.

✓ She always goes to the gym on Mondays.

*Frequency adverbs go before the main verb. The exception is the verb *be*, where the adverb goes after it.*

**3: Placing *still* at the end of the sentence.**

✗ He hasn't called me still.

✓ He still hasn't called me.

*Still* goes in mid position — before the main verb or the auxiliary. It does not go at the end of the sentence. Use *yet* at the end of negative sentences instead.*

## Useful Tips

📌 **TIP 1:** Remember the shortcut **F-M-E**: Front for connecting and scene-setting adverbs, Mid for frequency and certainty adverbs, End for manner and place adverbs. This simple pattern covers most adverb position decisions you need to make.

📌 **TIP 2:** When in doubt about where to put an adverb, try reading the sentence aloud in different positions. Native speakers often rely on what "sounds right," and with practice, you will develop the same instinct. Pay attention to adverb position when you read English articles or listen to podcasts.

📌 **TIP 3:** Keep a notebook of adverbs you learn and note which position they use. Group them by position (front, mid, end) rather than by meaning. Over time, you will build a mental map of which adverbs go where.
