# Dependent Prepositions — Part 1

In English, many verbs are always followed by a specific preposition. These are called dependent prepositions because the preposition depends on the verb — you cannot freely choose which one to use. Using the wrong preposition after a verb is one of the most common mistakes advanced learners make. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules for which preposition goes with which verb — they must be learned as fixed combinations. This page focuses on the most important verb + preposition combinations.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**

- Use the correct dependent preposition after common English verbs.
- Recognise and avoid common preposition errors with verbs.
- Form sentences using verb + preposition combinations followed by nouns and verb-ing forms.

## Verbs Followed by "for"

**Form:** verb + for + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Several common verbs are always followed by *for*. These include verbs related to waiting, searching, asking, and paying. After *for*, you can use a noun, a noun phrase, or a verb-ing form.

**Key rules:**

- **Wait for** — to stay somewhere until something or someone arrives.
- **Search for** — to try to find something.
- **Apply for** — to formally request something (a job, a visa, a grant).
- **Pay for** — to give money in exchange for something.
- **Apologise for** — to say sorry about something.
- **Blame someone for** — to say someone is responsible for something bad.

1. She **applied for** the position last week. (she formally requested the job.)
2. We are **waiting for** the bus to the airport. (we are staying until the bus arrives.)
3. He **apologised for** arriving late to the meeting. (he said sorry about being late.)

## Verbs Followed by "to"

**Form:** verb + to + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Many verbs are followed by the preposition *to* (not to be confused with the infinitive *to*). This group includes verbs about speaking, responding, and relating.

**Key rules:**

- **Belong to** — to be the property of someone, or to be a member of a group.
- **Refer to** — to mention or direct attention to something.
- **Respond to** — to reply or react to something.
- **Object to** — to disagree with something.
- **Look forward to** — to feel excited about something in the future. (Note: this is followed by verb-ing, not the infinitive.)
- **Contribute to** — to help make something happen or add to something.

1. This laptop **belongs to** the marketing department. (it is the property of the department.)
2. She **responded to** the email within an hour. (she replied to the message.)
3. We are **looking forward to** visiting the new office. (we are excited about the visit.)

**Native speaker note:** Be careful with *look forward to*. Even though *to* comes before a verb, it is a preposition here, not part of the infinitive. Always use verb-ing after it: "I look forward to *hearing* from you," not "I look forward to *hear* from you."

## Verbs Followed by "about"

**Form:** verb + about + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Verbs followed by *about* are usually connected to thinking, speaking, or feeling emotions about a topic.

**Key rules:**

- **Think about** — to consider something.
- **Talk about** — to discuss something.
- **Worry about** — to feel anxious about something.
- **Complain about** — to express dissatisfaction about something.
- **Dream about** — to have thoughts or wishes about something.
- **Forget about** — to fail to remember something.

1. She **worries about** missing her flight whenever she travels. (she feels anxious about it.)
2. They **complained about** the noise from the construction site. (they expressed dissatisfaction.)
3. He often **thinks about** changing careers. (he considers the idea.)

## Verbs Followed by "on"

**Form:** verb + on + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Several important verbs are followed by *on*, often related to depending, focusing, or deciding.

**Key rules:**

- **Depend on** — to rely on or be affected by something.
- **Rely on** — to trust or need someone or something.
- **Concentrate on** — to focus your attention on something.
- **Insist on** — to demand something firmly.
- **Spend (money/time) on** — to use money or time for something.
- **Congratulate someone on** — to praise someone for an achievement.

1. The schedule **depends on** the weather forecast. (the weather will affect the schedule.)
2. She **insisted on** paying for dinner. (she demanded to pay.)
3. They **spent** a lot of time **on** preparing the presentation. (they used their time for preparation.)

## Verbs Followed by "in"

## Common Errors

**1: Using the wrong preposition after *depend*.**

✗ The result depends of the final interview.

✓ The result depends on the final interview.

*Depend* is always followed by *on*, never *of*. This is a very common error, especially for speakers of Romance languages where the equivalent verb uses "of."*

**2: Using the infinitive instead of verb-ing after *look forward to*.**

✗ I look forward to hear from you soon.

✓ I look forward to hearing from you soon.

*In the phrase *look forward to*, the word *to* is a preposition, not part of the infinitive. Prepositions are always followed by a noun or verb-ing form.*

**3: Leaving out the preposition entirely.**

✗ She apologised being late.

✓ She apologised for being late.

*Many verbs require a dependent preposition before the object. Without it, the sentence is grammatically incomplete.*

## Useful Tips

📌 **TIP 1:** There is no grammar rule to tell you which preposition follows which verb. The most effective strategy is to learn verbs and their prepositions together as fixed pairs. When you record new vocabulary, always write the preposition with the verb: "apply *for*," "depend *on*," "believe *in*."

📌 **TIP 2:** When a verb + preposition combination is followed by a verb, always use the verb-ing form. This is because prepositions are followed by nouns or verb-ing forms, never by the infinitive. For example: "She insisted on *leaving* early," not "She insisted on *to leave* early."

📌 **TIP 3:** Pay attention to dependent prepositions when you read English texts. Highlight the verb + preposition combinations you find and add them to a personal list. Grouping them by preposition (all the "for" verbs together, all the "on" verbs together) can make them easier to review and remember.
