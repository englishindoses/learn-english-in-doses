# Complex Prepositional Phrases

Simple prepositions like *in*, *on*, *at*, and *for* are among the first words English learners study. However, English also has many multi-word prepositions — sometimes called complex prepositions — that are essential for advanced writing and formal communication. These phrases work just like simple prepositions but allow you to express more precise relationships between ideas. You will find them everywhere in academic texts, business emails, and news reports.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**

- Use two-word and three-word complex prepositions correctly in sentences.
- Choose between complex prepositions and their simpler alternatives depending on formality.
- Use complex prepositional phrases to add detail about reason, contrast, addition, and exception.

## Two-Word Complex Prepositions

**Form:** two-word preposition + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Two-word complex prepositions are made up of an adverb or adjective followed by a simple preposition. They express more specific meanings than simple prepositions alone. These are common in both written and spoken English.

**Key rules:**

- **According to** — used to report what someone else has said or written.
- **Due to** — used to give a reason or cause (similar to *because of*).
- **Apart from** — used to express an exception or addition (similar to *except for* or *in addition to*).
- **Ahead of** — used to express being in front of something in time or position.
- **Along with** — used to add someone or something to a group.

1. **According to** the manager, the deadline has been moved to Friday. (reports what the manager said.)
2. The flight was cancelled **due to** bad weather. (gives the reason for the cancellation.)
3. **Apart from** the hotel, everything about the trip was excellent. (the hotel was the exception.)

**Native speaker note:** *Due to* and *because of* are often used interchangeably in everyday English. Strictly speaking, *due to* follows the verb *be* ("The delay was due to traffic"), while *because of* follows action verbs ("We were late because of traffic"). In practice, most native speakers do not make this distinction.

## Three-Word Complex Prepositions

**Form:** preposition + noun + preposition + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Three-word complex prepositions follow the pattern: simple preposition + noun + simple preposition. They are very common in formal and academic English. Learning these phrases will make your writing more precise and professional.

**Key rules:**

- **In spite of** — used to show contrast (similar to *despite* or *although*).
- **In addition to** — used to add extra information (similar to *as well as*).
- **In terms of** — used to specify which aspect you are talking about.
- **On behalf of** — used to say you are acting or speaking for someone else.
- **By means of** — used to describe the method or instrument used (formal).
- **In favour of** — used to show support for something.

1. **In spite of** the rain, we enjoyed the walking tour. (the rain did not stop the enjoyment.)
2. **In addition to** her salary, she receives a travel allowance. (extra information about her income.)
3. The company voted **in favour of** the new working policy. (the company supported it.)

## Complex Prepositions for Reason and Cause

**Form:** complex preposition + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

Several complex prepositions are used specifically to explain why something happened. These are especially useful in formal writing, reports, and academic essays.

**Key rules:**

- **As a result of** — the situation that caused something.
- **On account of** — a formal way to say *because of*.
- **In view of** — considering a situation (often used before decisions or recommendations).
- These prepositions can be followed by a noun, a noun phrase, or a verb-ing form.

1. **As a result of** the new regulations, several flights were delayed. (the regulations caused the delays.)
2. The event was postponed **on account of** safety concerns. (the concerns were the reason.)
3. **In view of** the recent changes, the team decided to update the plan. (considering the changes.)

## Complex Prepositions for Contrast and Exception

**Form:** complex preposition + noun / noun phrase / verb-ing

**When to use it:**

These complex prepositions are used to show contrast (something unexpected) or to express exceptions (something that is not included).

**Key rules:**

- **In spite of / despite** — something happened even though there was a reason for it not to. (*In spite of* is followed by a noun or verb-ing; *despite* works the same way.)
- **Regardless of** — no matter what the situation is.
- **With the exception of** — everything except one thing.

1. **In spite of** being tired, she finished the entire report. (she was tired, but she still finished it.)
2. The museum is open every day, **regardless of** public holidays. (public holidays do not change this.)
3. **With the exception of** the final chapter, the book was very enjoyable. (every part except the final chapter.)

**Native speaker note:** *In spite of* and *despite* mean exactly the same thing. *Despite* is slightly more common in modern English because it is shorter. Never write "despite of" — this is always incorrect.

## Key Differences

It can be difficult to choose between a simple preposition and a complex one. Here is a simple guide:

- Use **complex prepositions** when you want to sound more precise, formal, or professional.
- Use **simple alternatives** in casual conversation or informal writing.
- Both forms are grammatically correct — the difference is mainly one of tone and register.

Compare these sentences:

- The project was delayed **because of** budget problems. (simple — works in any context.)
- The project was delayed **as a result of** budget problems. (complex — sounds more formal and precise.)
- **Besides** the cost, everything was fine. (simple — casual.)
- **In addition to** the cost, there were logistical issues. (complex — formal and detailed.)

## Practice: Sentence Reordering

Put the words in the correct order to make grammatically correct sentences.

**1.** in spite of / the delay / we / arrived / on time
**Answer:** In spite of the delay, we arrived on time.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. *In spite of* introduces a contrast and is followed by a noun.
**Incorrect feedback:** *In spite of* goes at the start, followed by the thing that did not prevent the action.

**2.** cancelled / the meeting / was / due to / a power cut
**Answer:** The meeting was cancelled due to a power cut.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. *Due to* gives the reason for the cancellation.
**Incorrect feedback:** *Due to* explains the cause. Place it after the main clause.

**3.** in addition to / experience / requires / this job / a degree
**Answer:** In addition to experience, this job requires a degree.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. *In addition to* adds extra information at the start of the sentence.
**Incorrect feedback:** *In addition to* introduces something extra. It goes at the beginning, followed by the additional item.

**4.** according to / the report / sales / increased / last quarter
**Answer:** According to the report, sales increased last quarter.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. *According to* reports information from a source.
**Incorrect feedback:** *According to* is used to state what a source says. It goes at the beginning.

**5.** she / on behalf of / spoke / the entire team
**Answer:** She spoke on behalf of the entire team.
**Correct feedback:** Correct. *On behalf of* means representing or acting for someone.
**Incorrect feedback:** *On behalf of* follows the verb and tells you who the person is representing.

**6.** regardless of / open / the shop / is / the weather
**Answer:** The shop is open regardless of the weather.
**Also accepted:** Regardless of the weather, the shop is open.
**Correct feedback:** That is right. *Regardless of* means "no matter what."
**Incorrect feedback:** *Regardless of* can go at the end or beginning. It means the weather does not change the situation.

**7.** as a result of / the company / new policies / introduced / customer feedback
**Answer:** As a result of customer feedback, the company introduced new policies.
**Correct feedback:** Well done. *As a result of* explains the cause of the action.
**Incorrect feedback:** *As a result of* introduces the cause. What caused the company to introduce new policies?

## Common Errors

**1: Writing "despite of" instead of "despite" or "in spite of."**

✗ Despite of the bad reviews, we watched the film.

✓ Despite the bad reviews, we watched the film.

*Despite* is never followed by *of*. If you want to use *of*, write *in spite of*. Both mean the same thing.*

**2: Using "according to me" to give a personal opinion.**

✗ According to me, the hotel was too expensive.

✓ In my opinion, the hotel was too expensive.

*According to* is used to report what someone else (a source, a report, a person) has said. For your own opinion, use *in my opinion* or *I think*.*

**3: Confusing "in addition to" with "in addition" (without *to*).**

✗ In addition to, the company offers free parking.

✓ In addition, the company offers free parking.

✓ In addition to a good salary, the company offers free parking.

*In addition to* is a preposition and must be followed by a noun or noun phrase. *In addition* (without *to*) is a connecting adverb and is followed by a comma and a new clause.*

## Useful Tips

📌 **TIP 1:** Learn complex prepositions in groups based on their function: reason (*due to*, *as a result of*, *on account of*), contrast (*in spite of*, *regardless of*), addition (*in addition to*, *along with*). This makes it easier to choose the right one when you are writing.

📌 **TIP 2:** When writing formal emails or reports, try replacing simple prepositions with their complex equivalents. For example, swap *because of* for *as a result of*, or *except for* for *with the exception of*. This small change can make your writing sound much more professional.

📌 **TIP 3:** Remember that complex prepositions are followed by nouns, noun phrases, or verb-ing forms — never by a full clause with a subject and verb. If you need a full clause, use the conjunction equivalent instead (e.g. use *although* instead of *in spite of*).
